Black sheer chiffon Chanel vintage... for a blouse.

A hot pink Nine West tight fitting skirt.

A pink Hermes Birkin bag.

A pair of Jimmy Choo Zen Suede Bootie beige shoes.

A pair of Prada sunglasses.

Chanel No. 5 for the day's perfume.

 

 

Danielle Marie Dirham is a walking designer brand. Wala na talagang nakareklamo when she claimed the hallway for her famous morning strut. No one can really stand in her way, be it a teacher, an authority or the administrator himself.

 

She raised one delicately plucked eyebrow when she saw a flirting couple on one side. The girl was pressed against the wall, rubbing the guy's chin. They were both smiling like two silly little people in love and Dama had to roll her eyes in annoyance.

"Do you mind?" She asked in a somewhat high-pitched annoyed voice.

Napatingin sa kanya ang dalawa and she was a bit taken aback when she saw the guy's face. He was smoking hot, she thought. He has a smooth face and a pointy nose. Nice eyes. Nice pair of lips... that are currently pressed into a thin line.

"Oh hi there!" She greeted him with a smile, totally ignoring the girl he's with.

"Do I know you?" He asked.

The girl stifled a laugh as Dama's smile turned to a shocked, muted, wounded and embarrassed look.

Madaling nakabawi si Dama at inirapan ang lalaki. "I'll forgive you for saying that if you're a transferee." She said to him, hoping that he will take back what he said or mend it in some way that would be pleasing to hear.

"No Miss, actually, I've been around this school for four years now. And I don't think I've ever seen you before. Are you a transferee?"

Hindi nakaligtas sa pandinig ni Dama ang panunuya ng lalaki. She gripped the handle of her expensive bag before letting off some air. Hindi nya pinakawalan ang composure sa katawan.

"Is that so? Well I guess you're just as ignorant as anybody else for not knowing who I am. And it seemed to me that you have a cheap taste with girls too." She smiled mockingly at the girl who was now glaring at her.

"Dahan-dahan ka sa pananalita mo Miss." The guy warned her.

"You are in no position to tell me what to do."

"How about being the son of the school's administrator? Won't that be high enough for you?" The guy crossed his arms.

Dama scoffed. "This school won't even exist if not for my family's shares. And I can see now that it's not worth it."

"You're such a bitch!" Sabat ng babae.

Dama removed her Prada sunglasses and bored her eyes on the girl who was half-hidden behind the guy.

"Me? A bitch?" She scoffed. "You should meet my mom!"

 

Her mom-Megan, is the only person in the world who has so much bitchiness enough to scare her. Pano ba naman kase? Nagmana lang sya dito. Much as she hates to admit it, her mom is the original bitch.

Even her dad is scared of her mom.

Come to think of it-everybody seemed to be scared of her mom.

 

"Come on Cindy. There's no point in talking to her." Said the guy. Hinawakan nya ang kamay ni Cindy at hinila ito palayo sa kanya.

"Do not turn your backs on me when I'm talking to you!"

The guy sighed exasperatedly before he turned to face her again. "Stop it, will you? Hindi ako interesado sa 'yo!"

 

Natigilan si Dama sa narinig. No one. No one in her life have ever said something like that to her. Sure, alam naman nyang maraming galit sa kanya dahil sa ugali nya but no one dared to say that to her face. And guys would actually jump at a chance to be with her-kahit ilang oras lang.

They would die for a chance because she is who she is.

And this guy... this guy blatantly rejected her in front of the whole school.

 

The girl gave her a puppy-eyed look. "Awww... did your little bitchy heart get broken?" 

 

She smiled bitterly at the girl.

 

 

 

 

"Don't you know already? I don't have a heart."

"So hold your head high, gorgeous. People would KILL to see you fall."

--

 

The incident didn't sit well with Dama. She was cranky all day. Lahat na tinarayan nya. Kahit mga teachers sa klase, sinasagot nya ng pabalang. She was not afraid of anyone. Hell, she's pissed off so they should be the ones scared.

"Miss Dirham, do you mind turning off your phone? You're in the middle of my class." Saway sa kanya ng professor nya. He was giving them a lecture about the famous historians of the world when she decided that she was bored, took out her phone from her bag and began tweeting.

At talagang ipinapakita pa nya yun sa prof para mainis itong lalo.

"With all due respect SIR, I find your subject so boring. I find YOU boring. So don't tell me to turn off my phone because I wouldn't be using it in the first place if you aren't so boring."

Nanlaki ang mga mata ng mga estudyante sa loob ng classroom. The teacher had too clear his throat several times to redivert their attention to him.

"With all due respect Ms. Dirham, if you don't like my class, feel free to drop this subject. I have no intention of dealing with you like this for the rest of this semester." Kalmado pero iritado nitong sagot sa kanya.

Dama's eyebrows shot up.

"Fine." She spit out. Tumayo si Dama at iniikot ang mata sa loob ng klase. "Enjoy your class bitches." She said in her sweetest voice then she turned to the teacher before she leave. "Oh and by the way--you're fired."

--

Pagkauwi nya sa mansion, mga katulong naman sa bahay ang pinagbuntunan nya ng inis.

"I told you to prepare me a milk bath! Nasan na? Hindi kayo binabayaran dito para tumunganga!" Inis na inis nyang sabi sa mga katulong na supposedly ay ipaghahanda sya ng pampaligo.

"Pasensya na po Miss. Marami po kase kayong ipinag-uutos kaya medyo hindi namin naasikaso agad--" The young maid quivered under her stare. She was about her age and had been one of her personal maids for two years.

"Nagrereklamo ka?" Mataray nyang tanong dito.

The maid shook her head vigorously. "H-Hindi naman po--"

"You listen to me... utusan ka. Amo ako. No matter how many errands I told you to do, dapat gagawin mo silang lahat ora mismo. Hindi kita binabayaran para magpahinga. Naiintindihan mo?"

"O-Opo."

"Good. Now get out of my face!" She pushed the maid out her room. Nang isasara na nya ang pinto, another maid--this time older--entered.

Dama laid in her queen-sized purple canopy bed and pointed to her walk-in closet.

"Find my Vivienne Westwood dress. Iron the plaids. I'll wear them tomorrow."

"Opo Miss."

The old maid did what was instructed and took out the Anglomania Multi Bale sunday dress from the closet.

--

At dinner, Dama was looking gloomier than the others at the table. Her dad and mom were busy chatting about their whole afternoon while her kid brother--Dylan Marco--was eating quietly.

She snapped her fingers. Isang katulong ang dali-dali lumapit sa kanya.

"I want an orange juice."

Tumango ang katulong saka nagsimulang maglakad papuntang kusina when she hold her up.

"Ano pa po Miss?"

"Freshly squeezed," she added.

Pinagtaasan sya ni Megan ng kilay.

"What?" Tanong nya dito.

"You never liked orange juice." Puna nito.

"So?"

Megan shrugged. "Nothing. How's school?"

She grunted. "A bore."

"May nagreklamo na naman sa 'yo. You know you have no right to fire a teacher."

"Since when did you meddle with my business?"

"Don't use that tone on me!"

"Girls! Wag naman sa hapag-kainan." Saway sa kanilang dalawa ni Dani. Bilang isang padre de pamilya--sadly, walang nakikinig sa kanya kundi ang anak nyang lalaki. Dani rolled his eyes as the two women went on bickering.

Medyo nagsasawa na rin sya sa ganitong eksena. Galing sa nakakapagod na trabaho, ito pa ang madadatnan nya pag-uwi sa bahay.

His daughter is constantly proving to be a bit too much to handle and his wife... well, pumapatol naman ito. Good thing he still have his son to keep him sane.

 

"Dad! She's not listening to me!" Dama pointed out to him.

"What is it this time Dama?" He asked exasperatedly.

"I said I want to get the administrator's son to be my boyfriend! I said it many times over! Hindi ba kayo nakikinig?"

"And why would you want that?" He raised an eyebrow, thinking that this is by far, the most ridiculous request he's heard from her in a long time.

Usually kase, Dama would request for a new condo unit (na hindi pinayagan ni Meg) or a yacht for her birthday party (na hindi rin pinayagan ni Meg.) Point being--hindi ito ang tipong magrerequest ng isang bagay na mag-iinvolve ng tao... unless of course, kapag may gusto syang ipa-fire na staff sa bahay or sa school (na hindi rin pinapayagan ni Meg.)

"Because I like him. That's why."

"If you like him, you don't have to force him to be with you." Sagot ni Megan.

"I'm not asking for your opinion." Pang-iirap nya rito.

"And I'm not asking for you to listen to my opinion. I'm just saying what I think. And I think that he doesn't like you." Nakangiti nitong sabi. Yung ngiting nagsasabing tama na naman ito.

"Of course he likes me!" She retorted.

"Oh dear, if he does, then you wouldn't have to ask what you asked."

She glared at her mother. "Would you just shut up?"

"If I do, then the meal would be boring."

"Mom, can you pass me the roast please?" Her kid brother asked her mom. Ngumiti dito si Megan saka iniabot ang ipinapakiusap ng bata.

"Here you go sweetheart."

 

Dama rolled her eyes. It's pretty apparent naman na paborito ng mama nya ang bunso nyang kapatid. He was always the smarter, the better, the kinder one.

Wala na itong nagawang mali sa mata ng mga magulang nya.

Of course, she's envious. Lahat kase ng pagmamahal ay napupunta rito. That's partly the reason why she was such a bitch in the first place. Parang lahat kase kailangan pa nyang hingin. Lahat kailangang paghirapan. Lahat kailangang ipakiusap.

Her kid brother doesn't have to ask for anything... kusang-loob na kaseng ibinibigay rito ang lahat.

 

"Thanks for the intervention noob." she said to him. Ngumiti lang ito sa kanya. Naiiling na ibinalik nya ang tingin sa mga magulang. "So what now?"

"No." Mabilis na sagot ni Megan.

She looked at her father. "Dad?"

"Well..." Dani looked at Megan and met her glare. He apologetically looked back at Dama. "Your mom said no."

Dama grunted. "What about you?"

"Sweetheart, liking someone isn't supposed to be forced. If he doesn't like you, then go find somebody else to like."

"He likes me nga Pa! He just doesn't know it yet!"

Meg laughed.

"Sorry... I just find it so funny!" Meg continued laughing. It was her mock laugh. The one na ginagamit lang nya kay Dama.

 

Dani gave out a defeated sigh and continued eating.

Si Dylan naman, tuloy lang sa pagkain. He admires his kid for being oblivious about the two women bickering. Siguro ay sanay na rin ito. Sa araw-araw ba namang ginawa ng Diyos--ganito lagi ang eksena.

That's why Dama wanted to own a condo unit in the first place. Lahat kase ng kilos nito ay minamanmanan at pinapakialaman ni Megan.

 

"Kapag hindi nyo ako pinagbigyan... titigil ako sa pag-aaral!" Banta ni Dama.

"So? Go ahead." Sagot naman ni Megan.

"Maglalayas ako!" Banta nya ulit.

"Ipag-i-empake pa kita, gusto mo?" Nakangiti nitong sagot sa kanya.

"Arrrgh! I hate you!"

Dama slammed her fists on the table, knocking off her plate and the utensils. Agad iyong pinulot ng mga katulong.

"If you won't do as I say... I'll--I'll slit my wrists!" Pananakot nya.

Dani looked helplessly at Meg. Si Megan naman, wala lang reaksiyon.

Dama smiled inwardly, thinking that she had finally won... when Megan spoke again.

"Yaya, pakikuha nga ng cleaver sa kusina."

Nanlaki ang mata ng lahat ng nasa hapag... pati ang mga utusan.

"P-Po?"

Meg snapped her head at the maid nearest to her.

"Bingi ka ba? I said get me the cleaver!"

"Meg what are you doing?" Tanong sa kanya ni Dani.

"She said she wanted to slit her wrists. I say *tingin kay Dama* why not take the hands off? Tutal naman magkaka-scar lang sya. Might as well amputate them."

Dama hid her hands under the table as the maid fetched the cleaver. Pagkabalik ng katulong, maingat nitong iniabot kay Megan ang hiningi. Pinilit iyong agawin ni Dani pero matigas ang ulo ni Megan.

Si Dylan, tahimik lang na nakatingin sa kanila, naghihintay ng susunod na mangyayari. Lahat ng katulong ay halos hindi na makahinga dahil sa takot.

Lumapit si Megan sa hindi na makagalaw na anak.

"Hold out your hands." She ordered.

"No!" Mariing pagtanggi ni Dama.

"I said hold them out!"

"And I said NO!"

Itinaas ni Megan ang cleaver.

Napasigaw si Dama. "Okay! Alright! I'm sorry!"

Satisfied, Megan handed the cleaver to a shaken maid.

"Next time, think twice about using your empty threats on me." Galit nitong sabi sa kanya. Megan went back to her seat and smiled at her husband. Then she looked back at her crying daughter. "Fine. I'll talk to the administrator." Sabi nya.

--

"You scared the hell out of everyone. Please don't do that again Meg."

"Yang anak mo kase, lumalaki na ang sungay."

"Kahit na." Yumakap si Dani kay Megan. "Nakakatakot pa rin yung ginawa mo."

"She doesn't respect me so I opted for the alternative."

"What--scare her?"

"Terrify her. She needs to learn her place in this house."

"Pero pinagbigyan mo din naman." Naiiling na sabi ni Dani.

"Para masaya." Nakakalokong sagot ni Megan.

--

The next day, Dama went to school looking like someone out of Vivienne Westwood's spring fashion show. She was wearing a leather cropped jacket over her Vivienne Westwood dress and a pair of peep toe heeled shoes from Prada.

She smiled to herself as she saw the guy from yesterday waiting at the gate, looking glum but still hot.

"Hi!" She greeted him. Inirapan lang sya nito. Sumimangot ng bahagya si Dama pero nagawa nyang kumawit sa braso ng lalaki. He didn't complain so she knew na nakausap na ito ng papa nito.

Lalong lumapad ang ngiti nya ng makita ang ex-girlfriend nito na nakalaglag ang panga.

She rushed to them and punch-slapped the guy hard on the face.

"How could you Krauss! And you! You bitch! Ganyan ka na ba kadesperada at nang-aagaw ka ng boyfriend ng may boyfriend?!"

Dama raised an eyebrow. "Inggit ka? Eh di mang-agaw ka rin ng boyfriend ng iba."

"Hindi ako katulad mo! I don't need to force myself to someone for him to like me!" Sagot nito sa kanya.

"Eh di ikaw na." She casually said. "Let's go boyfriend... My class is about to start."

Tahimik na sumunod si Krauss kay Dama.

"I should have known. You're just another asshole like the rest of the guys at this school. Bagay kayo--bitch at asshole. Match made in hell."

Nilingon ni Dama muli ang babae.

"Ah... so na-boyfriend mo na lahat?"

"Excuse me. Di mo ako katulad. I don't date guys like there's no tomorrow."

"Mas maganda lang ako sadya sa 'yo kaya mas maraming pumapatol sa 'kin."

"Pwede bang tama na?" Krauss finally spoke.

"Pwede naman. Yang EX mo lang kase... masyadong bitter."

"BITCH!"

Dama laughed. "I know right?" Binigyan nya ng mapang-asar na ngiti ang dalaga saka nya hinila si Krauss papunta ng classroom nya.

--

After a few days, nanatili pa ring malayo ang loob ni Krauss kay Dama. He doesn't kiss her. He does not hold her hand... willingly in public. He does not even smile at her.

When it was time for Dama's debut party, Krauss was expected to be there--to be her escort. Everything was well planned. Lahat perfect--the venue, the food, the guest list... even the dress.

Dama was beaming when she went out of her room. She walked up to the top of the grand stairs. Every one stopped chattering and looked up at her.

 

The ball room of the mansion was decorated in purple roses and silver dangling lights. The huge chandelier was donned with purple crystal and the guests were made to wear black and white. Si Dama lang ang naka-purple.

Purple gown--the dress was made by Vera Wang herself. It looks like a wedding dress--but purple.

 

Dahan-dahan syang bumaba ng hagdanan habang pinapalakpakan ng mga bisita. She had the urge to raise her right hand and wave at them pero natatakot syang bitawan ang dress nya at matapilok. So she held her dress with both hands.

Halfway across the stairs, her eyes met Krauss's. She smiled at him but that smile faded as quickly when she saw the girl in his arms--Reema, his EX.

She was smiling at her, wearing a hideous-looking purple gown.

She gaped at them and lost her balance. Ayun--semplang.

 

Nagtawanan ang mga bisita. She even saw her mom laugh at her. Sa galit, hinubad nya ang sapatos at ibinato sa mga bisita. It landed on the grape punch at the table.

Napatigil lahat sa pagtawa.

She glared at them.

"GO TO HELL! ALL OF YOU!" She yelled. Tinanggal nya ang natitirang sapatos at ibinato kay Krauss. Sumala--si Reema ang tinamaan sa mukha.

Dama hiked up her dress and ran upstairs.

 

While she was moping in her room, her parents apologized to the guests. Reema was sent to the hospital and the party went on... without the celebrant.

Even Megan doesn't look sorry at all.

"I'll just go and see if she's alright." Paalam sa kanya ni Dani.

"No." Pinigil nya ito. "Leave her be."

"But Meg--"

"She needs to learn Dani. Don't tolerate her dramas in life."

Dani pressed his lips together. "Masyado ka naman yatang malupit sa kanya Megan."

Megan gave him a wicked grin.

 

 

 

 

"You think that's cruel enough?"

*******************************************
[3] Chapter 2
*******************************************
Stress is caused by giving a fuck.

--

Clad in a designer dress, a mean look and vengence, Dama went to school in a sour mood. Lahat ng madaanan nyang estudyante ay kung hindi man nagbubulungan--ngingitian sya at babatiin ng belated  happy birthday--much to her disgust.

She raised her right hand and automatically, nilapitan sya ng katulong na kasa-kasama nya sa school. And yes--she have maids with her at school. Three to be exact. May bodyguards din sya na nakabuntot sa kanya saan man sya magpunta.

Why would she need those kung sa attitude pa lang nya ay wala ng makalapit sa kanya? Simple lang... she needs to remind other people that she is rich. By having these servants around her who'd do things at her will demostrates the power that not everybody in their school have.

 

Namataan nya ang isang nerd na taga-gawa nya ng assignment. Sinenyasan nya ito para lumapit sa kanya.

"Nerd... yung assignment ko?"

The nerd scrambled her bag para sa bagay na hiningi nya. Pagkakuha doon ay agad nitong iniabot kay Dama ang papel na naglalaman ng 4 pages ng essay na ipina-assignment sa kanila last week ng teacher nila sa English.

"Telma, basahin mo." Iniabot ni Dama ang papel sa katulong na nagngangalang Telma. Si Telma ay estudyante rin sa school nila--scholar ito ng parents nya.

"What can you say about it?" She asked makalipas ang ilang minuto.

"Miss, hindi ko pa po tapos basahin." Nag-aalangang sagot ng katulong.

"Ba yan! Bilisan mo kaseng magbasa!"

"O-Opo!"

 

Tumingin si Dama sa nerd na kaharap.

"Nasan yung sa 'yo?"

Agad iniabot ng nerd ang sarili nitong assignment kay Dama. Iniabot naman iyon ni Dama kay Maring--hindi na ito nag-aaral pero magaling ito sa English. Tumigil kase ito para mangatulong dahil walang pera.

Bakit hindi sya scholar? Kase ayaw nyang pumasok sa school ng mayayaman.. eh dun lang yung scholarship na offered ng parents ni Dama. It's like shooting two birds with one stone. Para may katulong si Dama sa school... at may tutor naman sya pag-uwi sa bahay.

Eh ayaw ni Maring ng ganoong setup. In her defense, sino ba naman ang gugustuhing palaging kasama si Dama--be it at school or at home?

 

"Pancho, ikuha mo ako ng upuan, nangangalay ako." Utos nya sa isang bodyguard. Agad naman  itong pumasok sa isang classroom at nanghiram ng upuan.

Naupo doon si Dama at pinanuod ang mga katulong na nagbabasa. Inorasan nya silang dalawa. Makalipas ang sampung minuto, she ordered them to exhange papers.

Nang matapos ang dalawa, tinanong niya ang mga ito.

"So... which is better?"

Parehas na itinuro ng dalawa ang assignment ni nerd. Dama looked at the nerd and smiled. Saka nya hinablot ang papel na itatago na sana ng nerd. 

"I'll take this."

"P-Pero... pinagpuyatan ko yan Miss!"

"Pakialam ko?" She answered. Tumayo sya at nagpatuloy sa paglalakad papunta sa building nila. Sa daan, sinalubong sya ng nanggagalaiting si Reema na may bangas pa sa mukha. Sinugod sya nito pero agad naman itong naharang ng mga guard nya.

"You bitch! Look what you did to my face!"

Pinagtaasan nya ito ng kilay. "O? May nabago ba?"

Nagwala ito. "Let me go!" Reema ordered the guard. She looked at Dama with spite. "I'll rip your face apart ng magtugma naman yang mukha mo sa ugali mo, you monster!"

"Aww... masyado ka naman yatang hot-headed? Why don't you cool it off?" She smiled and motioned at the bodyguard. "Throw her at the fountain."

"Po?" Gulat na tanong nito.

"Gagawin mo ba o sisisantehin kita?"

 

Nag-aalangang binuhat ng bodyguard nya ang kawawang si Reema at dinala sa malaking fountain na nasa may bungad ng school. She saw him mouth sorry to her saka nya ito ibinagsak sa fountain.

Marami ang nagulat. Marami rin ang natawa. 

"REEMA!"

 

Dama rolled her eyes when Reema's knight in shining armor came to her rescue. Walang atubili itong lumublob sa fountain para tulungan ang girlfriend na makaahon.

Lalong nainis si Dama sa nakita. She fished out her phone saka nagpipindot.

 

"Hello?"

"Mr. Lexington, cancel all the classes today." She said to the administrator.

"What? Why?"

"Ayokong makita ang pagmumukha ng mga estudyante ngayon."

"Won't it be easier kung ikaw na lang ang aabsent Miss Dama?"

"You know what would be easier than that? Pulling out our shares at your school. Would you like that?"

She heard a sigh on the other end.

"I'm sorry but I really can't do that."

"WALA KANG KWENTA!" Sigaw nya sa cellphone sabay bato nito sa sahig. Tiningnan nya ng masama ang mga katulong. "Ano? Hindi nyo yun pupulutin? Aantayin nyo pang maglakad yung cellphone ko pabalik sa 'kin?"

Nagmadali ang mga katulong sa pagpulot ng cellphone niya. Iniabot nila iyon sa kanya pagkapulot. Dama grimaced when she saw the scratch on the phone's surface.

"Call Mang Erning. Ipahanda ang sasakyan." Utos nya kay Maring.

"Saan po tayo pupunta?" Tanong nito sa kanya.

"Bibili ako ng bagong cellphone." Sagot niya dito.

"Pero Miss... ayos pa po 'to ah?" Takang-tanong nito sa kanya. 

"Ayoko na nyan. Lumapat na yan sa lupa."

"Eh Miss... sayang naman po ito. Ang mahal mahal pa naman po ng iPhone..."

Tiningnan nya ito ng masama. "Sa katulad mong mahirap--mahal yan. Sa katulad kong mayaman--barya lang ang halaga nyan. Wala akong pakialam kung nanghihinayang ka dyan... dahil ako hindi!" Kinuha ni Dama ang cellphone mula sa kamay ni Maring at ibinato iyon sa basurahan.

Tapos ay dumukot ito sa bag at kinuha ang isa pang cellphone.

"Hello lolo?"

"Apo! Napatawag ka?"

"Gusto kong mag-shopping... libre ba yung jet?"

"Uh--oo naman. Bakit? Saan mo ba balak mag-shopping?"

"Sa New York. Bibili ako ng cellphone."

"O bakit? Eh ano 'tong ginagamit mo? Hindi ba 'to cellphone?"

"Itatapon ko na rin 'to after this call."

"Apo..."

"Lolo please... masamang-masama ang loob ko ngayon. I need to vent out this anger."

"Magagalit na naman ang mommy mo."

"She doesn't need to know naman eh. It will be our secret, okay?"

"Hindi ba't may klase ka pa?"

"Tinatamad akong pumasok. Please lolo?"

 

She heard the old man sigh on the other end.

"Apo, maybe next--"

"Lo! It's your turn na!"

 Dama gripped the phone tightly when she heard her brother's voice.

"Lo! Is Dyma there with you?"

"Ah oo... naglalaro kami ng chess. Magaling din 'to ha! Manang-mana sa 'yo!" Bakas sa boses ng lolo nya ang tuwa kaya naman hindi nya mapigilang lumabas ang inis sa kapatid.

 Inagaw na nito lahat ng atensiyon na dati ay sa kanya.

First, it was her mom.

Then her dad followed...

Pati mga katulong at kasambahay at ilan nilang kamag-anak... pati ang mga lolo't lola niya... lahat ay pabor sa kapatid nya.

And now... even her great-grandfather is favoring Dyma. Samantalang dati ay sya ang spoiled na spoiled dito. Palibhasa kase, unang apo sa tuhod na lalaki si Dylan Marco kaya naman tuwang-tuwa ang lolo nya rito.

Idagdag pa na saksakan ng bait at galang ng kapatid nya kaya maraming matatanda ang natutuwa rito. Opposites nga daw silang talaga dahil kung anong bait ng kapatid nya--sya namang ikinasama ng ugali nya.

 

Sa inis niya ay naibato nya ulit ang hawak na cellphone. Agad naman itong pinulot ni Aling Carla, isa pang katulong, at nagmamadaling iniabot iyon sa kanya.

"Sinabi ko bang pulutin mo?" 

"A-Akala ko po kase--" Biglang nalito ang katulong sa sinabi nya.

Kinuha ni Dama ang cellphone mula sa katulong at ibinato iyon ng malakas. Nagkalasog-lasog ang kawawang cellphone.

"Ano ba yan! Lahat na lang ba ng tao sa paligid ko, kung hindi tanga--bobo? Mga wala kayong kwenta!" Nagsimula syang maglakad palabas ng school. Hindi pa man sya nakalalayo ay napalubog ang takong ng sapatos niya sa lubak ng daan. Nabali tuloy ito at muntikan na syang ma-off balance.

She glared at the girl nearest to her ng hindi nito napigilan ang tumawa.

"May nakakatawa?" Mataray nyang tanong dito. Agad tumigil sa pagtawa ang dalaga at umiling. Hinubad naman ni Dama ang sapatos--making the girl cringe dahil akala nito ay ibabato nya ito sa babae.

"Take off your shoes." She ordered the girl.

"Why?" Mahinang tanong nito sa kanya.

"Tatry kong ipamaypay kase ang init. May utak ka ba? Malamang para isuot ko!"

"Ano'ng gagamitin ko?"

"Bakit ko poproblemahin ang bagay na dapat ay pinoproblema mo? Ano--huhubarin mo ba yang sapatos mo o paglalanguyin din kita sa fountain?"

 

Walang nagawa ang dalaga kundi tanggalin ang sapatos. Dama removed hers saka ito ibinato kung saan tapos ay saka nya isinuot ang sapatos na mula sa babae.

"Name mo?" Tanong nya dito.

"Angel."

"Di bagay sa mukha mo." She pointed out saka nya nilayasan ang kawawang babae na walang nagawa kundi isuot yung itinapon nyang sapatos.

 

--

 

Hindi na natuloy ang balak na pagsa-shopping ni Dama kaya naman bugnot na bugnot sya ng makauwi sa bahay, Add the fact na wala na syang cellphone dahil itinapon nya pareho. Tapos nakapagsuot pa sya ng cheap na sapatos ng wala sa oras.

Kanina pa nga nangangati ang paa nya kaya naman, pagka-dating-dating pa lang nya sa bahay ay agad nyang hinubad ang sapatos at ipinatapon iyon sa katulong--na hindi naman talaga itinapon at itinago lang.

"Miss, ipinatatawag po kayo ng mama ninyo sa taas."

"Bakit daw?"

"Hindi ko po alam eh."

"Itanong mo muna saka ka bumalik dito."

"O-Opo."

Agad na umalis ang katulong sa harapan nya at nagmadali sa pag-akyat.

"Ay tanga... sumunod naman agad." Naiiling nyang sabi sa sarili.

 

--

 

Kasalukuyang kumakain si Dama ng inihandang merienda--cupcakes from Cupcakes by Sonja--ng  makababa ang katulong.

"Miss, hindi po sinabi kung bakit eh."

"Ganun?" Kumagat sya sa isang cupcake. "Eh di sabihin mo sya ang bumaba."

"Po? Eh..." Napakamot ang katulong. "Magagalit po ang mommy nyo."

"So okay lang sa 'yo kung ako ang magagalit?"

"Hindi naman po Miss... pakiusap po... umakyat na po kayo..."

Ibinagsak ni Dama ang kinakain. "Inuutusan mo 'ko?"

"Hindi po Miss. Nakikiusap lang po ako sa inyo. Masama pong magalit ang mommy nyo." Halos nagmamakaawang sabi ng katulong. Fresh pa rin sa alaala ng lahat ng kasambahay ang ginawa noon ni Megan sa hapag-kainan.

Akala talaga ng mga katulong, magsasaksakan na ang mag-ina nung gabing yun. 

 

"Masama rin akong magalit." Sagot ni Dama dto.

"Miss--"

Binato nya ng cupcake ang katulong sa mukha.

"Umalis ka na nga! Wala kang kwenta!"

 

"Dama!"

 

Halos mapatalon sa gulat si Dama ng marinig ang malakas na boses ng daddy nya.

"Dad!"

"Kanina ka pa tinatawag ng mommy mo ah?"

"Bakit hindi na lang sya ang bumaba dad? Sya naman ang may kailangan eh."

Naupo si Dani sa tabi ng anak.

"Sweetie, you're really getting into her nerves. Masama yan... hindi ka ba natatakot sa mommy mo?"

Dama looked at her father. "Bakit ikaw dad? Why are you so scared of her?"

Tumawa si Dani. "Me? Nah--I'm not scared of her. I'm in love with her."

Muntik ng masuka si Dama sa sagot ng daddy nya. LOVE? It doesn't even exists in her world. Wala sa bokabularyo nya ang salitang pagmamahal. She loves only herself. It's a necessity.

Ramdam naman nyang walang nagmamahal sa kanya. Everybody's scared of her. Her mom hates her. Her father--well... he's neutral.

Pero kung magkakaalaman na din lang, kung sakali mang mag-end of the world at isang tao lang ang pwedeng iligtas--for sure walang magliligtas sa kanya.

 

She knew it all along... alam nyang hindi sya ang first choice ng mga tao sa paligid nya. That is why she needs to stay strong for herself... dahil walang ibang gagawa noon kundi sya.

"DANIELLE MARIE DIRHAM, IF YOU DON'T COME UP HERE IMMEDIATELY, IPAPASUNOG KO LAHAT NG PABORITO MONG DAMIT! ISA!"

Dama cursed mentally.

"DALAWA!"

"Fine! I'm already walking!" Sigaw nya sa ina na nakadungaw mula sa puno ng hagdanan.

Padabog syang umakyat sa second floor.

 

Sinalubong sya ng nakapamay-awang na ina.

"What do you want?" Iritado nyang tanong dito.

"Pack your things."

"WHAT?!"

 

 

 

 

"You're leaving."

I didn't invent the word BITCH--I just perfected it.

"You're leaving."





Napamaang si Dama sa ina.

"You can't be serious?" Tanong nya rito.

"Yeah, you're right--I'm just kidding." Sagot ni Meg. Napahinga ng maluwag si Dama... "Do not pack you're things--you're leaving without them."

"What kind of sick joke is this?!"

"Sweetie... I don't joke about stuffs like this. You really are leaving."

Napadabog si Dama. "At saang bansa mo na naman ako ipapatapon? If you're going to send me out of the country, just please don't let it be in Japan. Ayokong makita si Nikolai."

Nikolai Anzo Rivera--her too-much-to-bear, childish and annoying cousin was currently living in japan with his parents. Ayaw na ayaw ni Dama dito. Palagi kase syang inaaalaska nito. 

Megan raised an eyebrow at her daughter. "Sino namang may sabing ipapatapon kita sa ibang bansa?"

 

Nagtaka si Dama. "Eh saan mo pa ako ipapatapon?"

"Let's make one thing clear--you're not leaving the country. You're leaving your sheltered life."

 "What?"

 

Megan rolled her eyes. "Tanga ka ba para hindi makaintindi ng English? O tatagalugin ko na para maintindihan mo... pinapalayas kita. Your bad attitude pollutes this house and frankly, hindi na kinakaya ng air freshener yang baho ng ugali mo." Mariin na sabi ni Megan.

Pinigilan ni Dama ang sarili sa pag-iyak--kahit gustong-gusto na niyang umiyak. No--she will never cry in front of her mother again.

Ayaw niyang magmukhang kawawa sa paningin nito.

 

"Mommy ba talaga kita? Why are you so cruel to me?"

Tumaas ang kilay ni Megan. "Nagtanong ka pa talaga? What I am showing you is the reflection of what you are showing to everybody else. Kaya 'wag ka ng magtaka kung ganyan kita itrato. Isipin mo na lang yung mga tao sa paligid mo na araw-araw mong sinasaktan."

Dama smiled bitterly. "Tingin mo sino'ng may kasalanan? Tingin mo ba kung maayos ang pagpapalaki mo sa 'kin, magkakaganito ako? I may be a bad child but that's just because I have a bad mother to start with."

Hindi na napigilan ni Megan ang sariling kamay. She took a few steps towards her daughter and slapped her hard.

"How dare you!"

Nagtagis ang bagang ni Dama.

"Yes! I dared! Yun naman talaga ang totoo eh! You don't love me enough kaya ako nagkaganito! Si Dylan lang naman ang mahal nyo eh! Si Dylan lang ang magaling! Si Dylan lang ang matalino! Sya na lahat!"

 

Megan looked at her grimly. "How can I love someone so unlovable?" She asked softly.

 

Yung mga salitang yun... tumagos sa puso ng dalaga. Pinipigilan nyang umiyak. Ayaw nyang umiyak. Pero masakit talagang makarinig ng masamang salita na galing pa sa sarili mong ina.

In the first place, ang ina dapat ang kauna-unahang magbubuo sa pagkatao ng anak. Sabi nga nila... no one can love you as much as your mother.

Sya na kahit hindi ka maganda--sasabihan ka ng maganda ka.

Kahit hindi ka matalino--ipinagmamayabang ka pa rin sa ibang tao.

Kahit hindi ka mahal ng iba--mahal na mahal ka nya.

 

Pero bakit ganito? Sarili nyang ina na ang may sabing hindi sya kamahal-mahal?

 

"Ang ugali, hindi mo kailangang ibase sa ibang tao. Sabihin na nating hindi nga maganda ang pagpapalaki ko sa 'yo... but that's not enough reason para maging masama ang ugali mo. May sarili kang utak. Hindi mo kailangang maging batayan ang pakikitungo sa 'yo ng ibang tao.

That does not determine who you are."

"I've heard enough already." 

"No. You haven't." Sabi ni Meg sa kanya. "My methods may be harsh but there's no other way around you. Hindi ka na bata na madali pang baguhin ang ugali. Dalaga ka na. Malaki na yang sungay mo."

"That's not enough reason para palayasin mo ako! I mean--come on! Can't you just rehabilitate me?"

Megan rolled her eyes. "Kung psychiatrist nga hindi ka kinaya eh, rehabilitation center pa kaya? Saka pwede ba, 'wag kang mag-inarte dyan. Think of this as your first step to independence. College ka na pero mangmang ka pa rin sa totoong buhay."

"Just because you grew up poor doesn't mean that I have to." Dama retorted.

"Do not insult my poverty. I became who I am today because of what I was."

 

Dama scoffed. "What? A bitch?" 

 

Megan smirked. "Nice comeback sweetie. Sige lubusin mo na. Hanggang mamaya ka na lang makakasagot ng pabalbal sa 'kin."

Napalunok si Dama sa sinabi ng ina. Mamaya? Shit. Ang bilis naman!

"Mamaya na agad? Excited ka naman masyado mommy. Pwede bang bukas na? Pagod na 'ko eh." She hoped that by the time na dumating ang kinabukasan, magbabago na ang desisyon ng mommy nya.

But she should have known better. When her mom makes a decision--no matter how rash and impulsive it may be--it's permanent. No redos. No second thoughts.

"Give me your credit cards." Utos ni Megan sa anak.

"What? No way!"

"Fine then. Mawawalan din naman yan ng silbi. And your phones?"

"I threw them away." Dama replied.

"Good. Magtiis ka ng walang phone."

 

"WHAT? This is just ridiculous!"

"At--hindi pa dyan nagtatapos." Nakangiting sabi ni Meg. "You will leave this house without a single shirt, dress, shoes, bags or accessories. Yang suot mo, hubarin mo na yan. Papahiramin ka ni Telma ng isang pares ng damit bago ka umalis."

Dama shielded her body when her arms. "There's just no way! Alam mo namang inaallergy ako sa pangmahirap na damit eh!"

"Kaartehan lang yan."

"I'll never wear cheap clothes!" Reklamo nya sa ina.

 

"Fine. Then you will go naked."

 

Dama gaped at her.

 

"Oh? Aarte pa?" Nakangising tanong ni Meg sa kanya.

 

"You're insane! DADDY!" She tried to call out for her dad. Meg silenced her.

"Wag mo ng bigyan ng sakit ng ulo ang daddy mo. He already agreed to this. Wala ka ng magagawa."

"Unbelievable!"

"I know right?" Pinindot ni Meg ang intercom na connected sa kwarto ng mga katulong. "Telma, come at the study." Tumingin sya ulit kay Dama. "I'll give you 20, 000 to buy your new clothes and toiletries. Your school things are taken care of already. Ini-enroll na kita sa isang public university. You'll finish your schooling there."

"Tingin mo matututo ako sa isang pangmahirap na school?"

"Eh di tingnan natin. Mukhang hindi kaya ng utak mo ang mamahaling school eh."

"Bakit twenty thousand lang ang ibibigay mo sa 'kin? That's not even enough to buy a new pair of shoes!"

"Eh di 'wag kang bumili ng branded!" Megan rolled her eyes. "Must I state the obvious? Magtipid ka! Matuto kang mag-value ng pera. Palibhasa kase, wala kang pinaghihirapan sa buhay kaya ganyan ka."

Dama crossed her arms. "So kasalanan ko pa palang lumaki akong mayaman?"

 

Megan gave out a sigh. "I'm not saying that. Sinasabi ko lang sa 'yo na kahit mayaman ka, may choice ka pa rin. You always have a choice. Kaya 'wag mong isisi lahat ng problema mo sa ibang tao."

Bago pa man makasagot si Dama ay nakarinig sila ng mahinang katok sa pintuan. Bumukas iyon at pumasok si Telma na may dalang nakatuping maong shorts at t-shirt na mukhang tig-iisang daan.

Napangiwi si Dama.

"I'm not wearing that!"

"Choice mo: Magpapalit ka o aalis ng nakahubad?"

Dama grunted. Saka nya hinablot ng damit mula sa kamay ni Telma. 

"Yuck. Ano ba naman 'to? Hinahawakan ko pa lang, nangangati na 'ko!" Reklamo nya. 

Bahagyang namula si Telma sa sinabi ng dalaga. Megan ignored her daughter's rant at si Telma ang kinausap.

"Nandyan na ba si Zelo?"

Tumango si Telma. "Nasa baba na po."

"Si Aling Pacing, handa na ba?" 

"Opo."

 

Bahagyang napangiti si Dama sa narinig. At least naman. hindi pa rin sya lubusang pinapabayaan ng mommy nya at isasama pa rin sa kanya si Manang Pacing--para may katulong pa rin sya.

 

"Who's Zelo?" She asked her mom. She's never heard that name before. 

Bodyguard kaya ito?

 

"Pinsan mo." Sagot ng mommy nya.

"Ha?" Nagtataka nyang tanong. "May pinsan akong Zelo ang name?" Weird. Wala akong maalala.

"Yes. Zelo Nasino... anak ni Aling Pacing. You will be living with them for the rest of your college life. And you will not be Danielle Marie Dirham for a while."

 

She looked at her mom quizzically. What now? Pati apelyido nya ay kukunin rin sa kanya?

 

 

 

"You will be known from now on as Daniella Nasino... a nobody."

AN: Ang dami ng spoiler noh? Whahaha... See you sa next update. ^^

Salamat!

*******************************************
[5] Chapter 4
*******************************************
I don't hate you. I'm just not necessarily excited about your existence.

--


Pilit pinatatahan ni Dani ang anak na kanina pa umiiyak sa kanya. Naaawa na sya rito pero kahit sya ay wala na ring magawa. Out of bounds na ang ugali ni Dama. She's bitchy even to the executives of the company. Wala na itong sinasanto and frankly--sobrang sumasakit na ang ulo nya sa panganay.

That's why napapayag siya ng asawa sa plano nito.

 

It's not as harsh naman as it sounds. She'll be well taken care of by Manang Pacing and Zelo. She'll be treated as one of the family. Para nga lang nagpapaka-independent si Dama.

Sure, she'll be rid off her things and name (for a while) pero para iyong lahat sa ikabubuti niya. Hindi na mapagsabihan si Dama ng mag-asawa. Kung hindi pa ito gagamitan ng dahas--like the cleaver scene--ay hindi pa ito makikinig... which is not healthy.

"Tahan na anak... it;s going to be alright soon. 'Wag ka na lang magreklamo pa para wala ng gulo."

"She's so unfair dad! Ganito ba dapat ang trato nya sa anak nya?"

Daniel sighed. Hinagod-hagod nya ang anak sa likod. "Don't worry. Your mom knows what she's doing. Magpakabait ka lang at kapag nakita nyang nagbago ka na--she'll take you back."

"I hate her dad. I so hate her!"

"Ssshh... don't say that..."

 

Pinahid ni Dani ang mga luha ng anak. Then he held her chin and smiled.

"I know you. You're strong. Hindi ka basta-bastang magpapatalo. If you would cry and give up this early... then you just proved to her na mahina ka. Na talunan ka. You wouldn't want that now, would you?"

Umiling si Dama at nagpahid ng luha.

"No. I'll show her dad. This won't break me."

 

--

 

Matapos makipag-usap ni Megan sa katulong na si Aling Pacing ay pinalabas na niya si Dama mula sa mansion. Nakaabang na din doon si Zelo, na tatayo bilang pinsan at guardian ni Dama.

Maya-maya'y lumabas ang dalaga na walang dala kahit ano. Nakasimangot ito at mukhang kaiiyak. Namumula din ang braso nito na malamang ay kinamot nito kanina dahil sa pangangati mula sa damit na suot.

Totoong nangangati si Dama sa mumurahing damit... but that's not because of allergy. Nag-iinarte lang talaga ito kase hindi sanay.

Pinalapit nya ito sa kanila.

 

"Dama... this is Zelo... he's going to be your cousin until you graduate. Zelo... paki-disiplina ng anak ko ha?"

"Tsk." Umirap si Dama sa ina.

"Be nice to him... sya ang maghahawak ng pera mo."

"What?! The eff naman ma! Can't I handle my own money?" Reklamo niya.

"Kung ikaw ang hahawak ng pera mo, malamang wala pang isang araw, ubos na yung weekly budget mo. He's going to handle your money and that's final." Sunod na inadress ni Meg si Manang Pacing. "Manang, 'wag mong itu-tolerate yang kaartehan ng anak ko ha? Kung ayaw nyang kumain, hayaan mo syang magutom. Patulungin mo rin sya sa gawaing bahay ng matuto."

Dama gaped at her mother. In her 18 years of existence, ni hindi pa sya nakakahawak ng walis tambo. Hindi pa sya nadidikitan ng alikabok.

Lalong-lalo na namang hindi pa sya nakakahawak ng maruming pinggan!

 

Isipin pa lang nyang gagawin nyang lahat yun--parang gusto na nyang mahimatay.

 

"Sige na, lumakad na kayo."

Dama ran to her father. "Bye dad... I will miss you."

Dani kissed her on the top of her head. "I will miss you too. Stay safe, okay?"

"Yes daddy."

Kumalas sya sa pagkakayakap sa ama at sumunod sa papalabas na sina Manang Pacing at Zelo--ignoring her mom on the way. Nasasaktan man sa inasal ng anak--mas pinili na lamang ni Meg na manahimik. Kasalanan din naman nya. Kagagawan din naman nya kung bakit nagkaganyan ang panganay nya.

But she was praying... hoping... begging even--na sana ay magbago ang anak nya.

She really loves her daughter... and hates her at the same time. Such feelings cannot co-exist in her heart. She hopes that one of them would cease to exist... and prayed it be the latter.

 

--

 

First time sumakay ni Dama sa tricycle kaya naman nauntog sya agad sa mababang bubong nito. First time din niyang aalis ng bahay ng naka-tsinelas. First time niyang maging ganito kadikit sa katulong.

At first time nyang maging hopeless.

 

Pagkadating niya sa bahay ni Manang Pacing, napanganga na lang sya sa gulat. Barong-barong ang bahay nito. Iisa lang ang pintuan. Walang gate. May mga lasenggerong kapitbahay. May maduming kanal sa gilid.

She was so disgusted she wants to hurl right away.

"Pagpasensyahan mo na ang bahay namin anak ha? Wala pa kase akong pampaayos eh."

"No kidding. This place looks like hell." She replied with a grimace.

 

"Hell? O tamang-tama... kamukha ng ugali mo." 

 

Pinanlisikan nya ng mata si Zelo. All the while, nananahimik ito na akala mo'y santo sa sobrang bait. Yun pala inaantay lang nitong makaalis sila sa mansion.

"Zelo!" Saway ni Manang Pacing sa lalaki. "Kaunin mo muna si Meera at pagabi na. Baka nakikipaglaro na naman yun kung saan."

Umirap ang lalaki sa kanya at sumunod sa pinag-uutos ng ina.

 

"Halika. Pasok ka sa loob."

"Wala bang hotel man lang na malapit dito? Bawal akong madapuan ng lamok."

"Kabilin-bilinan ng mommy mo na dito ka tumira."

"Kasya ba naman tayo dyan?"

Kanina pa nya iniisip kung paano magkakasya ang mag-iina sa isang napakaliit na bahay. Kung doon nga sa dating tinitirhan ng parents niya, nabubunggo na sya sa mga furnitures eh... dito pa kaya na mukhang 1/4 lang non?

Tumawa ang matanda. "Nagkakasya naman kami."

 

Umakyat sila sa tatlong palapag na hagdanan bago makapasok sa loob. Kung madumi itong tingnan sa labas... kabaliktaran naman iyon ng loob nito.

Malinis at maaliwalas ang bahay. Iisang bumbilya lang ang bukas... at yun ay yung nasa sala. Made of wood ang flooring pati na rin ang mga dingding. Wala silang kisame kaya kitang-kita yung skeleton ng bahay,

May isang kwarto lang na natatakpan ng kurtina. Dama guessed that that's the bedroom. Yung kusina, katabi lang ng sala. Pati yung CR na nasa bandang dulo.

Walang faucet--tabo ang gamit nila.

Wala ring TV.

At ang pinaka-masaklap--walang aircon.

 

--

 

Nangangalay na ang braso ni Dama sa kapapaypay habang si Manang Pacing naman ay nagluluto ng hapunan ng biglang dumating ang magkapatid na Zelo at Meera. Madungis ang batang babae at amoy-araw pa. Nakadikit ang buhok nito sa pawisang mukha at leeg.

"Nanay!" Tumakbo ang bata sa naglulutong ina at yumakap.

"Ay ano ka ba namang bata ka! Pawisan ka na naman!"

Ngumiti lang si Meera.

"Magbihis ka na." Utos dito ng kuya nito.

"Yes kuya." Akmang papasok ng kwarto ang bata ng makita sya nito. Agad itong tumakbo at naupo sa tabi nya.

Todo iwas ang dalaga dito dahil allegic din sya sa pawis--ng mahirap.

"Hi ate!"

"Pwede bang lumayo-layo ka kid? Ayokong mahawa sa amoy mo." She crinkled her nose saka mas nilakasan ang pagpapaypay.

Napasimangot ang bata. "Ay... ang sungit mo naman ate."

 

"Layuan mo ya Meera... baka mahawa ka."

 

Dama glared at Zelo.

"Zelo..." Saway na naman ni Manang Pacing dito.

"Nay... sinasabihan ko lang ang kapatid ko. Ayoko namang bukas-bukas eh tutubuan na rin 'to ng sungay."

"Ano ba'ng problema mo ha?!" Mataray nyang tanong dito.

Zelo gave her a bland look. "Hindi ba obvious? Ikaw ang problema ko."

"Zelo anak... tama na."

"Oo nga naman kuya. Masamang nang-aaway ng babae." Pagsang-ayon ni Meera sa ina.

"Tss." Pumasok si Zelo sa kwarto.

 

--

 

"Anak kain ka na." Aya ni Manang Pacing kay Dama pagkatapos nitong maghain ng hapunan. Naupo si Dama sa isa sa mga plastic chairs na talaga namang ikinairita nya dahil masakit sa pwet. Kaya inutusan nya ang batang si Meera para kumuha ng throw pillow na nasa sala at sya nyang ipinatong sa upuan.

She looked disdainfully at the food on the table. NFA rice ang sinaing. At ang ulam--TUYO at kamatis.

"Wala na bang ibang ulam?"

"Wala na." Sagot ng kakaupo lang na si Zelo. "Kung ayaw mong kumain, matulog ka na lang."

"Allergic ako sa tuyo." She pointed out.

"Allergic o nag-iinarte?"

"It's true! Allergic nga ako sa tuyo! Ask my mom!"

 

Manang Pacing sighed. "Zelo anak, bumili ka muna ng ulam kay Mang Benoy."

"Nay 'wag na." Tumingin ito kay Dama. "Dito na sya nakatira kaya dapat matuto syang kumain ng pagkain natin."

"Eh allergic nga ako sa tuyo! Hindi ka ba nakikinig?!" Pagtataas nya ng boses dito.

"Anak bili ka na ng ulam, sige na..." Pakiusap ni Manang Pacing kay Zelo. Napabuntong-hininga naman ang binata at kinuha ang perang kanina pa iniaabot ng ina.

 

--

 

"What the hell is this?"

"Ulam." Replied Zelo. 

"Ano'ng klaseng ulam 'to? At bakit naka-plastic?"

Zelo rolled his eyes. "Ano'ng gusto mo? Ipalagay ko sa palad ko yung ulam? Kung ayaw mo yang kainin, eh di 'wag. Hindi kita pinipilit."

Napasimangot si Dama sa choices nya... it's either tuyo or that horrible-looking thing on a cheap plastic.

Pero ng kumalam ang sikmura nya, saka sya napilitang kumain.

 

Bahala na kung magka-indigestion sya mamaya.

 

--

 

When it was time to go to bed, nagkaroon na naman ng malaking problema si Dama. Saan sya matutulog? Halos 1/8 ng bed nya ang laki ng papag na nasa kwarto. Wala naman syang pakialam sa iba dahil doon talaga nya planong matulog.

She was just worried about her back--paniguradong sasakit ang likod nya dahil hindi sya sanay mahiga sa matigas na papag.

"Wala ba kayong kutson?" Tanong nya kay Manang Pacing.

"Wala eh. Gusto mong ipanghiram kita sa kapitbahay?"

"Sige. Manghiram ka na rin ng unan... gusto ko yung malambot. Saka electric fan man lang--mygosh! Ang init init dito!" Napapaypay sya ng mahina.

"O-Oo sige."

 

"Hindi ka magkukutson."

 

Dama rolled her eyes. Ano ba naman 'tong lalaking 'to? Dakilang kontrabida?

"Pwede bang 'wag kang sabat ng sabat sa usapan ng may usapan?"

"Umayos ka ng pananalita mo. Nanay ko ang kausap mo kaya matuto kang gumalang." Mariin nitong sabi sa kanya,

Pinagtaasan nya ito ng kilay. "And so? Yaya ko naman sya."

"Dito sa pamamahay namin--hindi mo sya yaya. Hindi mo pa ba nare-realize? Kasinghirap ka na rin namin... kaya ayusin mo yang ugali mo."

"Excuse me... mayaman pa rin ako kaya 'wag na 'wag mo akong ikukumpara sa inyo. Temporary tenant lang ako dito--at katulong ko pa rin sya." She pointed at Manang Pacing. 

 

"Ano ba yan... kanina pa kayo away ng away ah?" Reklamo ni Meera. 

"Oo nga naman. Tama na ang pag-aaway ha? Magpahinga na tayo pare-pareho. Marami pa kayong gagawin bukas." Manang Pacing said in a resign voice. Inayos nya ang papag at nilagyan ng maraming unan. "Tabi na kayo ni Meera. Sa sala na lang kami matutulog ni Zelo. Sya... magsitulog na kayo."

 

Wala ng nagawa si Dama kundi matulog sa matigas at malamig na papag. Lahat kase ng gusto nyang mangyari ay hinaharang kaagad ni Zelo. And to think na first day pa lang nya sa bahay na 'to.

That night, she had the most uncomfortable sleep of her life. The first of many.

 

--

 

Kinabukasan...

*splash*

 

"Arrrrgh! Yaya ano ba--"

Napabalikwas si Dama ng maramdaman nya ang malamig na tubig na isinaboy sa kanya ng kung sino. Galit na galit siya at akma na sanang babatuhin ng matigas na unan ang salarin when her eyes met his cold stare...

 

"Bumangon ka na. Tanghali na."

 

Pagkasabi'y lumabas na ng kwarto si Zelo.

 

Napasigaw si Dama sa inis. "PUNYETANG BUHAY 'TO!!"

 

xxxx

AN: I'm not sure if I can keep this third person's POV. Am I boring you so far? Wag naman sana. :> Night! ^^ Shoutout sa mami ni Dayuuuum! Hehe... Para sa inyo 'to!

[6] Chapter 5
*******************************************
Oh darling... go buy a personality!

--

"HOY! WAG KANG TATALIKOD HANGGAT KINAKAUSAP PA KITA!" Iritadong pahabol ni Dama kay Zelo. Lumabas sya ng kwarto ng basang-basa ang mukha at blouse dahil sinabuyan sya ni Zelo ng tubig.

First day of school kase ni Dama kaya kanina pa sya ginigising ni Manang Pacing. Nakapasok na't lahat si Meera ay natutulog pa rin ang dalaga. Narinig ni Zelo na bumuntong-hininga ang ina at bumulong ito sa sarili na... Pabayaan na nga.


Magtu-tooth brush na sana si Zelo eh. Pero yung ipapangmumog nya sana ang natripan nyang gawing panggising sa dalaga. Effective naman eh--bumangon ito agad.

Zelo rolled his eyes. "Naririnig pa rin kita kahit nakatalikod ako."

 

"Nag-aaway na naman kayo? Umagang-umaga ah." Puna ni Manang Pacing na naghahain ng agahan nila.

"Eh eto kaseng anak mo! Walang respeto sa katawan!" Bulyaw ni Dama sa matanda.

Doon sya nilingon ni Zelo, he was glaring at her again.

"Wag mong pagtaasan ng boses ang nanay ko!"

Napapitlag si Dama sa biglang pagtataas ng boses ng binata.

"Zelo anak..." Saway sa kanya ng ina.

Hindi iyon pinansin ni Zelo. Nagpatuloy ito sa pagsasalita. "Umayos ka ha!" Dinuro-duro nito ang noo ng dalaga. "Nasa pamamahay ka namin. Lumugar ka!"

Dama sneered. "Tss. Bahay? You call this a house? Eh kahit aso namin aayawang tumira dito eh!"

"Kahit naman sino aayawang tumira kung saan ka naron. Yang ugali mo--singbaho ng hininga mo." Zelo crinkled his nose. "Mag-toothbrush ka nga!"

Nahampas sya ni Dama sa sobrang inis. Hindi naman nasaktan si Zelo at tinawanan lang ang napahiyang dalaga.

 

"Tama na nga yan... mahuhuli na kayo sa pagpasok." Saway ni Manang Pacing sa kanila. "Oo nga pala... hija... yung uniform mo, naplantsa ko na. Nakalagay yun sa sala. Isuot mo na lang mamaya."

"Uniform?" Dama gave her a quizzical look. "Nag-u-uniform kayo? Yuck! How cheap! Halatang hindi makabili ng maraming damit!"

"O eh ano ngayon?" Pambabara ni Zelo sa kanya.

Inirapan lang ni Dama ang lalaki at pabagsak itong naupo sa hapag kainan. Itlog at tuyo ang ulam--na sobrang ikinadismaya ni Dama.

"Walang french toast?"

"Walang french toast?" Zelo mimicked her in her own annoying voice. "Wala. Wag kang kumain kung ayaw mo."

"Gusto mo ba ng toast? Bibili ako ng tasty bread." Manang Pacing offered.

"Wag na! Di ako nakain ng bread na hindi whole wheat."

"Arte. Pare-pareho din namang tinapay yun." Pabulong na remark ni Zelo na hindi naman nakaligtas sa pandinig ni Dama.

"FYI lang poor guy. Yung mga cheap na tinapay na nabibili mo lang sa tabi-tabi--hindi kasing-sustansya ng kinakain ko!"

"Bakit parang wala namang epekto sa 'yo?" He retorted.

 

"Ay ano ba yan... Zelo anak... maligo ka na. Sige na."

Agad na sumunod ang binata sa ina at naligo ito agad habang si Dama naman ay simangot na kumain ng agahan.

 

--

 

Pagkatapos mag-agahan, naligo na rin si Dama at hinalungkat ang mga gamit na pampasok. Sinabi sa kanya ni Manang Pacing na galing sa mommy nya ang mga gamit. May mga fresh underwears para sa kanya na laking pasasalamat naman nya at branded.

May cellphone din na nakalagay sa loob.

"Yuck. Nokia Asha? Tss." Mas mahal pa yung dati nyang Hermés belt kesa sa phone na binigay ng mommy nya. But still--it's better than nothing.

Nadismaya sya ng maisuot ang nakahandang uniform.

"Mukha akong teacher na maraming utang!" She lamented. Maluwag ang puting blouse at ang katerno nitong gray pencil skirt. 

Huli nyang pinuna ang sapatos na hindi nya malaman-laman kung ano'ng tatak kase Korean.

"Isa lang ang sapatos ko?" Reklamo nya.

"Dalawa yan. Isa sa kanan, isa sa kaliwa." Sagot ni Zelo sa kanya.

She glared at him at saka muling hinalungkat ang bag.

 

"Ba yan! Walang makeup?!"

"Sa school ka pupunta, hindi sa party."

"Bakit ka ba nangengealam ha?" Pagtataray nya rito.

"Tama na ang away... pumasok na kayo sa school at baka ma-late pa kayo." Saway ni Manang Pacing sa kanila.

 

"Let's go manang." Utos ni Dama sa matanda.

"Ano ka grade 1? Ang laki-laki mo na, magsasama ka pa ng katulong sa school?" Pangongontra na naman ni Zelo sa kanya.

"Anak, hindi kase ako pwedeng sumama sa school nyo."

"And why not? You'll come with me!" Pagpupumilit nya sa matanda. Poor girl--she can't even fathom the idea of going to school without a maid or a bodyguard... baka pagkaguluhan sya ng mga tao!

Sikat pa naman sya.

 

Humugot ng malalim at nagtitimping hininga si Zelo saka kinaladkad ang dalaga palabas ng bahay. Dama kept on punching him pero wala lang itong epekto sa lalaki.

She was dragged halfway from the house ng tumigil si Zelo sa paglalakad. Hinarap sya ng binata.

"Ikamamatay mo ba kung aalis ka ng bahay ng mag-isa ha?"

"Hindi mo kase alam yung feeling ng pinagkakaguluhan ng mga tao! You don't understand what I need to go through everyday!"

"Tanga ka ba? Ano pa bang parte ng nobody ang hindi mo naiintindihan? Dito sa lugar namin-hindi ka kilala kaya 'wag kang mag-ilusyon dyan na pagkakaguluhan ka ng mga tao. Baka nga wala pang pumansin sa 'yo eh."

 

Sinimangutan nya ang lalaki. Ayaw man nyang aminin pero mukhang tama ito. Hindi sya kinukuyog ng mga tambay sa daan. Ni walang maka-recognize sa kanya. Siguro ay dahil na rin kase sa kahirapan ng mga tao sa paligid nya.

They don't look like the kind who would read a copy of a high-end magazine or the business columns of the newspaper.

Ang mga taong kagaya nila--tabloid lang ang alam basahin. They don't watch business or lifestyle television--all they watch are cheap mediocre shows and clichéd teleseryes.

"Maglalakad tayo papuntang school?" Pag-iiba nya ng topic.

"Bakit? Marunong kang lumipad?"

"Hindi ka ba marunong sumagot ng maayos ha?" Iritado nyang tanong sa binata na wala ng ginawa kundi ang barahin sya.

Zelo sighed. "Maglalakad tayo. Dalawang kanto lang naman ang school mula rito."

"Dalawang kanto?!" She looked at the road ahead. Nasaan ba ang dalawang kanto na sinasabi nito?

 

Never pa syang nakapaglakad ng ganun kalayo. Ang tamad-tamad nya pa namang maglakad. Palagi kase syang naka-kotse. Pagpunta nga lang sa second floor ng bahay nila, kinatatamaran na nya eh... yun pa kayang dalawang kanto ang layo?

"Pwede bang 'wag ka ng umangal? Nasasaktan ang tenga ko sa dami ng reklamo mo eh!"

She was currently in the middle of thinking for a good comeback ng biglang may isang lalaki na patakbong lumapit sa kanila. He has a wavy, brown hair and a smile that instantly irritated Dama--for she is not known to be a fan of smiling and happy faces.

"Good morning Zelo! Kamusta na pre?"

"Uy Eli..." 

Nilingon naman ni Eli si Dama saka ito nginitian. "Hi!"

Dama gave him her usual response--inirapan nya ito.

"Sungit." He looked back at Zelo. "Girlfriend mo?"

 

Parehong kinilabutan ang dalawa.

"Eli! Umagang-umaga nagmumura ka!" Kinikilabutang sabi ni Zelo. 

"Excuse me lang!" Singit ni Dama. "I'll never date a guy like this in a billion years!"

"Wow nosebleed." 

"Pagpasensyahan mo na yang pinsan ko... may sayad kase yan."

 

Biglang nakaramdam ng awa si Eli para sa dalaga.

"Awww... sayang. Ang cute nya pa naman..."

Pinalis ni Dama ang kamay ni Eli na nag-pa-pat sa ulo nya.

"Tanga ka ba? Sinabi lang nya--naniwala ka na? FYI lang DORK... wala akong sayad! Baka yan pang lalaking yan ang meron!"

"Bakit ba galit na galit ka na agad? Parang jinu-joke ka lang namin eh." Eli replied.

"Wala kaseng sense of humor yan." Sagot naman ni Zelo.

 

Ngali-ngaling tapakan ni Dama ang paa ni Zelo para makaganti pero nagsimula ng maglakad ang dalawang lalaki. Nandun sya sa bandang hulihan nila habang nagkikwentuhan naman ang dalawa.

True enough, pagkalampas nila ng dalawang kanto ay agad nilang natanaw ang school. Isang public university. Maraming side vendors. Maraming nagkalat na estudyante sa labas.

Maraming mukhang dugyot na nababad sa araw.

Maraming nakakasakit sa mata ni Dama.

 

There is this one girl though. She looked like she could be of some use. Humiwalay si Dama sa mga kasama at nilapitan ang babaeng kasalukuyang nakaupo sa upuang semento na nakaikot sa puno ng mangga--naglilipstick ito.

 "Hoy ikaw!" Bati ni Dama sa kanya.

Kunot noong tumingin ang babae sa kanya. "Yes?"

"Give me your makeup kit." Utos nya rito.

"Uh--excuse me lang miss... pero parang hindi naman yata kita kilala? Sino ka ba ha?"

"You don't know me?" Mataray nyang tanong rito. She was a bit disappointed kase akala nya ay fashionista ang babae and thought that she might recognize her--sideline kase ni Dama ang pagmomodel sa mga magazines kapag wala syang magawa at gusto nyang painitin ang ulo ng mga photographer dahil sa kaartehan nya. "Listen to what I would say carefully dahil hindi ko na 'to uulitin sa 'yo. My name is Danielle--"

"Pinsan! Nandyan ka lang pala!" Biglang umakbay sa kanya si Zelo--disabling her to continue her little speech. Saka ito tumingin at kunwari ay bahagyang nasurprise ng makita ang kausap ni Dama. "Oh? Nagkakilala na pala kayo ni Eula..."

"Hi Zelo." Bati ni Eula sa lalaki.

"Eula! I missed you!" Si Eli naman, biglang yumakap sa dalaga.

"Ano ba Eli!" Iritadong sabi ng babae dito sabay tulak.

"Ano bang meron sa araw na 'to at ang susungit nyo ha?" Takang-tanong ni Eli sa dalawang babae.

 

"Sina Lei at Keeme, wala pa ba?" Tanong ni Zelo ay Eula.

"Wala pa. Si ate, papasok pa lang. Si Keeme--malamang nakikipag-away na naman kung saan."

 

Magkapatid sina Eula at Analeigh--or Lei as she is commonly known. Tolentino pareho pero parang north and south pole sa layo ng ugali. 

"Speaking of Lei..." Sinundan nila ang tingin ni Eli. From afar, nakita nilang naglalakad ang kapatid ni Eula na si Analeigh. Naka-salamin ito at nakatirintas ang buhok. Nakapamulsa rin ito at hindi tumitingin sa daan.

 

Dama smiled to herself. At last! She finally found someone who could be her slave! A NERD!

Nang makalapit si Lei sa kanila ay nagbatian sila ng good mornings. Lei's eyes lingered on Dama.

"Sino 'to?" Tanong nya sa mga kaibigan.

"Pinsan ni Zelo." Sagot naman ni Eli.

 

"Hi nerd." Dama waved at her.

 

Agad natigilan ang tatlo.

"What did you just call me?" Nasusuyang tanong ni Lei sa dalaga.

"Nerd. Why? Got a problem with that?" Mataray nyang sagot dito.

Lei scoffed. "Aba at talagang inulit pa!"

"Natural. Tinanong mo 'ko weh."

Nilapitan ni Lei si Dama at hinalot nito ang collar niya.

"Hoy babae. 'Wag mo akong matawag-tawag na nerd kung ayaw mong mabangasan kita ha!"

"Eh bakit ka ba nagagalit?!"

"Naririndi ako sa 'yo!"

"Kung ayaw mong tawagin kitang nerd--then don't wear glasses!" Naiinis nyang sabi kay Lei habang pilit na tinatanggal ang kamay nito sa collar ng blouse nya.

"Tanga ka ba? Malabo ang mata ko kaya ako nakasalamin!"

"Eh malay ko ba!"

"Common sense tanga! Gusto mo bigyan kita?"

 

"Ate, awat na. Umagang-umaga nang-aaway ka eh..." Saway ni Eula sa kapatid.

"Oo nga. Saka give her a break Lei... bagong salta lang sya." Dagdag ni Eli.

"Fine!" Napipilitang sabi ni Lei saka binitawan ang damit ni Dama. "Bakit kulang kayo?" Tanong nya sa tatlong kaibigan.

"Wala pa yung isa eh." Sagot ni Eula sa kapatid.

"Kita ko. Kaya ko nga kayo tinatanong kase napansin ko eh."

"Ayan na oh--" Tumuro si Eli sa bandang kanan nya. 

 

Nakita nilang naglalakad ang mukhang kakagaling lang sa away na si Keeme. Nakabukas ang polo nito at may pasa ito sa kaliwang side ng lower lip nito.

"Yo." Matamlay nyang bati sa kanila.

"Yo yourself. Basag-ulero ka talaga." Puna ni Eula dito.

"Di na kayo nasanay." Naiiling na kumento ni Zelo.

Ngumuso si Keeme sa kanila. "Pucha ako na naman? Trending topic na naman ako, kakadating ko nga lang?!"

Binatukan sya ni Lei. "Tigil-tigilan mo nga yang kaka-trending topic mo na yan! Trending topic ka ng trending topic--ni wala ka ngang twitter!"

"Aray naman! Masama ng makiuso?" Iritadong tanong sa kanya ni Keeme.

 

Tumikhim si Dama. Keeme's attention automatically diverted to her.

"O sino 'to?" Tanong nya sa kanila.

"Pinsan ni Zelo."

"Eh? May pinsan ka?"

"Natural." Sagot ni Zelo sa kanya.

"O ano? Tutunganga na lang kayo dyan? Malapit ng mag-start ang klase!" Sita ni Eli sa kanila. Nauna na itong maglakad papunta sa department nila.

Nagsisunudan naman silang lima.

 

--

 

Classroom.

Maingay. Magulo. Madumi. Malayong-malayo ito sa kinasanayang classroom ni Dama. Sa kanila kase, parang theater style ang classroom at parang sofa ang mga upuan sa lambot. Tiled pa ang sahig na alaga sa pagsa-shine ng mga janitor at janitress.

Itong classroom na 'to... semento lang at alaga sa floorwax kaya amoy floorwax ang sahig. Mamula-mula pa!

 

Kanya-kanya silang hanap ng upuan.

Si Eula, sa unahan pumwesto. Syempre, para madaling mapansin ng teacher at saka para makita agad sya ng mga estudyanteng mapapadaan. Alam nyo na... nagmamaganda na naman.

Sina Analeigh at Zelo, parehong pumwesto sa tabi ng bintana. Magkasunod sila ng upuan. Tinabihan naman ni Dama si Eli na nasa bandang gitna.

Si Keeme, nasa tabi ng ikalawang pintuan sa likod--para kaunahan syang makakalabas ng classroom kapag dismissal. Pwede rin na kapag may gustong makipag-away, sisenyasan lang sya mula sa labas at madali na syang makakapuslit.

 

Kakaupo pa lang nila halos ng biglang pumasok ang isang teacher na sa tantya ni Dama ay nasa early 40s na nito. His hair was balding already and he has a huge belly. 

"Good morning." Bati ng teacher. "Mukhang may bago tayo ah?" Ngumiti sya kay Dama. Saka nya ito pinapunta sa unahan. Nagtaas ng kilay ang dalaga saka iniikot ang tingin sa mga bagong kaklase.

Lahat sila ay nakatingin na sa kanya.

 

Oh how she loved the attention!

 

She stood up and held her head high saka naglakad papunta sa unahan. Tapos ay nilingon nya ang mga kaklase.

"What's your name hija?" Tanong sa kanya ng prof.

"Danielle--"

 

She stopped midway. She totally forgot about her name issue! Muntik na nyang masabi ang pangalan na pansamantala nga pala nyang hindi pwedeng gamitin.

Who would believe her anyway?

Sa katagalan ng pause nya ay hindi naiwasan ang snide remarks na mula kay Lei.

"O ano? Nakalimutan ang sariling pangalan?"

 

Dama pressed her lips in annoyance while trying to remember the surname that she should be using.

"Mr. Nasino, ikaw na nga ang magpakilala sa pinsan mo." Naiinip na sabi ng teacher.

Tumayo si Zelo at akmang pupunta na sa unahan when Dama raised her right hand to stop him.

 

"Ang pangalan ko ay Daniella Nasino..." She felt something stick inside her throat. Pride nya yata. She couldn't shallow it down. No... not just yet. "--but I insist you call me DAMA."

[7] Chapter 6
*******************************************
Bitch please... you've got more issues than Vogue.

Lunch.

Nagkaayaan ang magbabarkada na kumain sa paborito nilang kainan--ang KUBO kung tawagin sa tapat ng first gate ng school nila. Maraming pagpipilian ng pagkain doon saka mura pa. Since first year, doon na sila kumakain.

Ang titibay lang... consistent sila ng 3 years.

Actually, doon nagkakila-kilala sina Zelo, Keeme at Lei.

 

Kasalukuyang kumakain ng lunch si Zelo ng bigla na lang naupo si Keeme sa tapat nya. Nakatingin lang noon si Zelo kay Keeme which made Keeme ask: "Ano? May angal ka?"


Simpleng umiling naman si Zelo at nagpatuloy sa pagkain.

 

Si Lei, hindi pa sya ka-close ni Eula dati. Masyado kaseng girly ang kapatid nya for her taste kaya palagi itong yamot sa kapatid. Eula--being the pretty and popular girl that she is--had many friends na palagi nitong nakakasabay sa pagkain.

Kaya si Lei... palaging kumakain ng mag-isa. Eh sakto noon na wala ng available na kainan. Classmate nya naman si Zelo nun pero hindi sila close. Actually, hindi nga sila nag-iimikan dati. He's too... quiet for her taste kaya hindi nya ito kinakaibigan.

Pero nung araw na yun, kinapalan ni Lei ang mukha nya at basta na lamang naupo sa tabi ni Keeme--na ikinagulat naman ng dalawang lalaki.

"Huy nerd, lumipat ka ng upuan!" Bulyaw sa kanya ni Keeme.

Napipikang lumingon sa kanya si Lei. "Ano'ng sabi mo?"

"NERD. I-spell ko pa para sa 'yo?"


Tinotopak si Lei kapag tinatawag syang nerd. Automatic na yan. Kaya naman hindi na napigilan ng dalawang lalaki ng isupalpal ni Lei ang biniling ulam na giniling sa pagmumukha ni Keeme. Maang na napanganga si Zelo sa gulat.

At ang malala? Hindi nag-walk out si Lei. kinuha pa nya ang ulam ni Keeme at yun ang kinain nya.

Ang lagay eh naging laughing stock si Keeme ng mga estudyanteng kumakain doon.

 

The next day, oddly enough--the three found themselves sitting on the same spot. Awkward sa umpisa pero ng di nagtagal, nakapagbiruan na sila. Nagpalibre pa si Keeme ng isang order ng giniling bilang bayad ni Lei sa pagpapahiya sa kanya. 

Lumipas ang ilang linggo at nanatiling ganoon ang setup nila. Then one day, Eula joined in. May nakaaway kase syang isang barkada dahil nilalandi sya ng boyfriend nito. Hindi naman nya iyon pinatulan pero nagalit pa rin ang kaibigan nya sa kanya.

Tinawag na syang malandi at maharot--na nasa loob daw ang kulo.

Mang-aagaw. Sulotera.

At ewan ba nya kung bakit hindi man lang sya naipagtanggol ng ibang kabarkada. Siguro ay dahil na rin sa lihim silang naiinggit sa kanya dahil sya ang madalas pansinin ng ibang tao. Naglabasan na sila ng baho. Lahat ng noon ay pinag-uusapan nila behind her back--lumutang na ngayon.

Eula was so hurt that she chose to see the one that she knew would be totally honest with her--her ate. At saan nya ito nakita? Ayun--dun sa kubo, masayang kumakain kasama ang dalawang lalaki na hindi nya pa kilala. Tourism kase ang kinukuha ni Eula habang ang ate naman nya ay BS Management.

Si Keeme, Electronics ang kinukuha.

 

Nang maging magkakaibigan silang apat--nag-shift ng course sina Keeme at Eula. Lei, who is one year older than them--is supposed to be in her fourth year na. Kaso kinatamaran nyang pumasok nung mismong finals week.

Ayun--umulit.

But little did her sister know... na ayaw lang nyang grumaduate habang nasa college pa ang kapatid. She may not look the part but she loves her sister with her whole heart. Hindi man maipakita ng simpleng salita, naipapakita nya naman ito sa mga mumunti niyang gawa.

 

Pinaka-huli nilang nakilala si Eli. Nag-transfer kase ito nung second sem ng first year. Madaling kaibiganin si Eli dahil friendly sya at nakakatuwa. Kaso medyo may pagka-uto-uto at tatanga-tanga kaya they all take turns on keeping an eye on him.

 

--

 

"Ano 'to?" Mataray na tanong ni Dama ng hainan sya ng mga kasama ng giniling. Giniling ang paborito nilang bilhin sa kubo. Hindi nawawalan ng giniling sa lunch nila. Kahit magkanya-kanya man sila ng ulam, rest assured na pag-aambaganan nila ang isang order ng giniling tapos hati-hati sila dun kahit tig-dadalawang kutsara lang.

"Ulam." Sabay-sabay nilang sagot.

"Ano'ng klaseng ulam 'to?"

"Giniling yan." Sagot ni Eli.

"Ano'ng lasa?" Tanong na naman ni Dama.

Lei rolled her eyes. "Eh di tikman mo!"

"Hindi ba nakamamatay 'to?" She eyed the food with caution.

"Shunga! Kung nakakamatay yan, eh di sana 3 years ago pa kaming patay!"

 

"Kumain ka na lang. Ang dami mong reklamo eh." 

 

Dama took one spoonful saka tinikman ang ulam. She shrugged. In all fairness--hindi naman nakamamatay ang lasa.

"Ano?" Tanong nila.

"Okay lang."

 

OKAY LANG is an understatement. Dahil naubos ni Dama ang isang plato ng kanin and had the nerve to buy an extra rice. Ikinatuwa naman nilang lahat iyon kaya bumili sila ng dessert.... minatamisang saba.

"Dama... willing ka bang maging kaibigan namin o hindi?"

"Huh? Should I be friends with you?" Takang-tanong ni Dama.

"Kung hindi mo kami kakaibiganin, makakaaway mo lang kami. If I were you, I'd avoid that... kase masama kaming kaaway." Lei stated.

"Ganun? Eh pano ba yan... masama rin akong kaaway?" She asked, smirking.

 

 

"Ha! Eh di fine! Pero times five ang hate na matatanggap mo mula sa 'min... kakayanin mo kaya?"

"Why don't you try and oppose me?" Kampante nyang sagot.

"Kapag di ka sumali, di kita bibigyan ng allowance." Sabat naman ni Zelo.

 

Nagtawanan ang lima sa reaction nya.

"Fine! I'll join your group thingy!" Napipilitan nyang sabi.

"Good. First thing's first, you have to pass our initiation." Eula said.

"What initiation?" Kunot-noo nyang tanong sa lima. Nagkatinginan ang mga ito at nagpalitan ng makakahulugang ngiti. Kinuha ni Lei ang kutsara nya. Saka sya pumisang sa minatamis na saba. "Kailangan mong kumain nito gamit ang kutsara na ginamit na namin."

"What?! Yuck! There's no way!" Pagtanggi niya.

"Bahala ka. Kaya mo naman sigurong tumagal ng walang allowance no?" Nangingiting tanong ni Zelo.

Dama grunted.

 

Ibinigay ni Lei ang kutsara kay Zelo. "Nagawa na namin 'to nung kaming tatlo pa lang nina Zelo at Keeme. Ginawa na rin 'to nina Eula at Eli kaya 'wag kang mag-inarte dyan."

Kinain ni Zelo ang saba at ibinalik kay Lei ang kutsara.

Next, she took a piece of the dessert and handed it to Keeme--who ate it readily. Naulit iyon ng tatlo pang beses.

Iniabot ni Lei yung last piece kay Dama.

"Come on, eat it." Utos nito sa kanya. 

Dama looked disgustingly at the spoon while thinking of how many germs had been left lingering there.

"Tagal naman!"

 

She contamplated on her choices. Kay Zelo pa lang talo na sya eh... nandito kase ang allowance nya. She took a deep breath saka kinuha kay Lei ang kutsara.

Isinubo nya iyon with her eyes shut.

They cheered for her.

 

"Welcome to the group Dama!"

"Yey! Let's celebrate! Inom tayo mamaya?" Aya ni Keeme.

"Saka na ungas. May quiz pa tayo bukas. Sabado na lang? Ano guys?" Lei asked.

"Sabado? Nako... hindi kami pwede eh." Sagot ni Zelo. "Sasamahan ko kase 'tong pinsan ko para bumili ng damit nya."

"Damit ba kamo? Pwedeng sumama?" Eula inquired.

"Eh di sasama na rin ako." Pahabol naman ni Lei.

"Ano? Tapos hindi nyo kami isasama?" May halong tampong tanong ni Eli.

"Madaya! Pasama din kami!" Keeme added.

 

Nagpalipat-lipat na lang ang tingin ni Dama sa lima. Sa bilis nilang mag-usap, hindi na sya nakaangal pa.

"O sige. Pagkatapos nating mamili, saka tayo nonomo. Ayos ba yun sa inyo?" Tanong ni Lei sa kanila.

"Call ako dyan!"

"Ako din!"

"Sige game!"

 

"Oy Dama, ano? Okay lang ba yung plano sa 'yo?" Tanong ni Eli sa dalaga.

Inirapan nya ito. "Kung kelan nakapag-decide na kayo, saka mo ako tatanungin?"

"Okay lang yan sa kanya. Para namang makakatanggi yan eh nasa 'kin ang pera nya?" Nakangising sabi ni Zelo. Nagtawanan ulit sila.

 

--

 

Uwian. Magkakasabay sina Eli, Dama at Zelo sa pag-uwi. Si Keeme, may ibang lakad. Yung magkapatid naman--natural sabay umuwi.

Pagkadating sa bahay, agad na pumunta sa hapag kainan ang dalawa para kumain muna. Pagkatapos kumain... nagtalo na naman ang dalawa.

Ang dahilan?

 

Ayaw maghugas ng pinggan ni Dama. Eh mapilit si Zelo. Ayun, nagbubulyawan ang mag-pinsan sa kusina habang ang mag-ina naman ay nasa sala at nagtuturuan ng assignment.

Hindi na nila iniintindi yung dalawa kase ayaw namang magpasaway.

Dama was forced to do the dishes dahil hindi sya pinapayagang matulog ni Zelo hanggat hindi nahuhugasan lahat ng nasa lababo.

She spent half an hour washing them. Nadudulas sa kamay nya ang pinggan--salamat na nga lang at plastic yun. Tapos reklamo pa sya ng reklamo dahil hindi man lang daw sponge ang gamit nila kunsi Scotch Brite na sobrang gaspang sa kamay.

Ngali-ngali na ngang ibuhos ni Zelo yung tubig sa timba ng manahimik ang dalaga kundi lang sya nanghihinayang sa effort nya sa pag-iigib ng tubig.

 

After that stressful dish-washing, naglinis na ng katawan si Dama at nahiga sa matigas na papag. Her thoughts wandered on the things that happened on her first day on her new school.

Ang dami nyang firsts na naranasan.

 

First time maglakad papuntang school.

First time pumasok ng walang yaya o bodyguard.

First time na kinalaban at sinagot-sagot ng mga taong hindi nakakakilala sa kanya.

First time kumain ng giniling.

First time kumain ng may kasama.

First time gumamit ng kutsarang ginamit na ng iba...

 

Pero sa lahat ng first times na yun... isa lang ang first na nagbigay ng ngiti sa kanya.

 

 

 

First time nyang magkaroon ng kaibigan.

 

xxxxx

AN: Uh--'wag na kayong magtaka kung lalambot din si Dama on the chapters to come. Hindi naman po ako gumawa ng ganitong story para lang maipakitang magaling magtaray yung bida. Personally, I want them to soften up. I want to expose their vulnerability.

Kaya kung naghahanap ka ng all out bitchiness... then I guess this is not it. 

Comment po? ^^

I wish I had a lower IQ so that I could think of an insult you'd understand.

Dama made sure that she set the alarm of her new cheap phone before going to bed. Ayaw na nyang magigising sa buhos ng tubig mula sa atribidang pinsan-pinsanan.

Pero kinabukasan...

 

*splash*

Napasigaw ng mura ang dalaga.

"Ano ba!" Nangggagalaiti sya sa pinsan-pinsanan na nakatayo lang sa tabi ng higaan nya, may naka-drape itong towel sa balikat at tooth brush sa bibig. Yung ipangmumumog sana nito ang ipinambuhos nito sa kanya.

"Tanghali na." He said blandly.

"So?! May alarm ako!"

"Sho?" Pang-gagaya nito sa kanya. Zelo removed his tooth brush from his mouth. "Bumangong ka nga ak magwalish ng bakurang. Bilish!" Tumatalsik-talsik pa yung bula mula sa bibig nito na lalong nagpa-irita sa dalaga. 

"Kadiri! Lumabas ka na nga! Natatalbugan ako ng virus mo!" Itinulak nya palabas si Zelo at saka hinanap sa higaan ang cellphone nya.

Mabuti na lang at nasa ilalim ito ng unan--sayang din naman kapag nabasa. Wala syang pamalit.

 

Padabog syang lumabas ng kwarto. Nakita nyang nagbibihis ng uniform na pampasok ang batang si Meera.

"Good morning ate!" Nakangiting bati nito sa kanya.

"Walang maganda sa morning kaya 'wag kang ngumiti dyan."

"Ate bat basa ka?" Kunot-noong tanong ng bata.

"Tanong mo sa kuya mo!" Pairap nyang sagot. She stormed to the bathroom para maligo. Sinadya nyang unahan si Zelo na kakaigib pa mandin ng tatlong timbang tubig. Bilang ganti--inubos ni Dama ang tatlong timbang iyon.

Galit na galit si Zelo paglabas ni Dama ng cr. Napa-igib pa tuloy ito bago nakaligo ng maayos.

 

--

 

School...

Uso pala sa kanila ang mag-antayan sa ilalim ng punong mangga. Hindi na nagulat si Dama ng makita niyang nakaupo dun sa paikot na semento si Eula at nagpapaganda na naman. Parang ganung order din sila laging dumarating. Kaunahan sa school si Eula, tapos dadating silang tatlo nina Zelo at Eli. Saka darating bigla si Lei at pinakang-huli naman si Keeme.

 

Hindi rin uso ang politeness sa magbabarkada.

Naranasan na ni Dama ang mahablotan ng kinakain... courtesy of Keeme. Ang halos minu-minutong pambabara ni Lei. Ang nakakairitang pangaral ni Eula. Ang pagiging shunga ni Eli na nakakaapekto rin sa utak nila.

At syempre pa, ang pang-aalaska ng pinsan nya.

 

First time nya ring makaranas ng hayagang pangongopya sa katabi. Hindi kase sya nag-aral kagabi kaya eto sya... umaasa sa papel ni Eli. Magkakatabi silang anim during the quiz. Si Zelo ang pinakang-mina ng sagot. Pasimple naman iyong kokopyahin ni Eli. Tapos sinisilip naman ni Dama. Si Lei naman sa kabila ni Zelo tapos si Keeme... na nanghahablot ng papel kapag hindi maintindihan yung sinusulat ng katabi.

But oddly enough, si Lei at Zelo lang ang tumataas ang scores. Si Lei kase, mayaman sa stock knowledge. Si Zelo.. matalino talaga saka masipag mag-aral. Pagdating kay Eli, naiiba yung sagot ni Zelo.

Namamali kase ng spelling.

"Kokopya ka lang mali pa?!" Reklamo sa kanya ni Dama during lunch break.

"Eh sorry naman! Tintakpan kase ni Zelo yung papel nya." Depensa ni Eli.

"Tinatakpan ko pa yun? Eh halos ilagay ko na nga sa armchair mo yung papel ko."

"Ang liit mo kase magsulat!" Nakapout na sabi ni Eli.

"Madamot ka lang talaga!" Naiiritang sabi naman ni Dama sa pinsan.

 

Lei defended Zelo. "Kayo na nga ang nangongopya, kayo pa ang nagrereklamo?" Inisa-isa nyang tiningnan ang apat. "Next time kase--mag-aaral kayo!"

"Kuu! Nagsalita! Porket naka-20 over 30 ka lang, nagmamayabang ka na?" 

Binatukan ni Lei si Keeme. "Lul! 21 ako, di lang pinagbigyan yung isa kase namali ng spelling!"

"Kelan pa naging right ang wrong spelling? Duh? Shunga lang?" Si Dama ang nagsalita.

"Wow... nahiya naman ako sa TWO mo teh!" Lei retorted.

"Oy kumakain tayo. Respeto naman." Saway ni Eula sa kanila.

 

"Nagsalita ang zero." Pambubuko ni Keeme.

"Luh--zero ka?" Tanong ni Eli sa kanya sabay tawa. Nagsisunudan na rin sila. Mga adik lang eh. Palagi silang ganun. Kaya palaging agaw atensiyon sa mga kumakain sa kubo.

Kaingayan kase sila.

 

--

 

Sabado.

Isinuot ulit ni Dama ng damit ni Telma dahil wala pa rin syang ibang damit. Napipilitan na nga lang syang magsuot ng daster sa bahay eh. 

Kagaya ng napag-usapan, ngayon sila mamimili ng mga bagong damit nya. Excited na syang makapasok ulit sa mall at bumili sa mga paborito nyang stores. She wished na sana nandun pa yung black and gold dress sa Nine West na nakita nya last week.

Excited na syang bumili ng bagong damit. Never pa kase syang nag-ulit ng damit sa buong buhay nya--let alone damit ng katulong.

"Sang mall ba tayo mamimili?"

"Mall?" Takang tanong ni Zelo sa kanya. 

She nodded. "Glorietta na lang ha? Mas maraming boutiques dun eh."

"Mall?" He sneered. "Asa ka? Sa palengke tayo mamimili."

"Ano? Ayoko!"

 

Ni hindi alam ni Dama ang itsura ng palengke. She has this crazy idea in her head na sobrang dami lang ng tao at basura tapos nagkalat sa kalsada ang mga tinitinda ng palengke sa Pilipinas. Isa pa lang kase ang napupuntahan nyang palengke--ang flea market sa Greece.

"Ayaw mo? Ayaw mo talaga?"

She huffed. "Eh kase naman--"

"Wag ka ng mag-inarte dyan. Lilimang libo lang ang pera mo."

"What?! My gosh! That's not even enough for a pair of earrings!" Dama's earrings are usually worth 15K or so. The cheapest was seven. 

Zelo rolled his eyes at her. "Maraming hikaw dun... tig-lilimang piso."

"For sure naman magkakasugat-sugat ang tenga ko dun."

"Eh di 'wag kang maghikaw."

 

She sighed. "Wala na ngang pabango, wala pang earrings? Mygosh--I'm so poor!"

"Indeed you are." Nakangising sagot ng binata.

inirapan nya ito. "Whatever. Pagka-graduate ko naman, balik na 'ko sa dati kong buhay."

"That is--kung makaka-graduate ka."

"Naman!"

"Quiz pa nga lang, bokya ka na eh. Pano pa kaya sa finals?" Naiiling na tanong ni Zelo. Lumabas na sila ng bahay para daanan si Eli.

"Syempre quiz lang yun. Di yun importante. Babawi na lang ako sa finals."

"Wag ka ng umasang papatularin kita ng sagot."

"Eh di 'wag! FYI lang--I have four other friends that I can count on!"

Tumawa ng malakas si Zelo.

 

"Ayos yan! Kita-kita kayo next year!"

 

Hindi na lang pinansin ni Dama ang sarcastic remarks ng pinsan. Mabuti na lang nga at lumabas na ng bahay si Eli. Ayun... naglakad na sila papuntang palengke.

 

--

 

Sa palengke...

"Grabe, ang init!" Reklamo ni Dama.

"Magkutsara ka."

"HAHAHA. Nakakatawa sya promise!"

"Ang adik nyong magpinsan no?" Puna ni Eli.

"Oo nga, buti hindi kayo nagpapatayan sa bahay no?" Lei inquired.

"Hayaan nyo--malapit na." Nakangising sagot ni Dama.

"Kapag pinatay mo 'ko, hindi mo malalaman kung san ko itinatago yung allowance mo kaya mag-ingat-ingat ka."

"Tsk. Wala ka na bang ibang pang-blackmail?"

"Wala na eh. Gawa ka ng katangahan para merong bago." Sagot nito sa kanya.

 

"Teka nga, san ba kase tayo bibili?"

"Ayan o!" Tumuro silang lima sa iba't ibang dereksyon. "Ang dami-dami ng tindahan eh."

 

Dama rolled her eyes at the options presented to her. Bukod sa cheap na nga at low-quality, pare-pareho pa ang mga style.

She could she a whole line of shirts na iisa lang ang design--malaking heart sa gitna. Kulay lang ang naiba.

Tinulungan naman syang mamili ng mga kasama. Syempre pa, lahat inayawan nya--pero given na nakay Zelo ang pera nya, si Zelo na ang bumibili kahit ayaw nya.

All in all, nakabili sila ng 50 shirts and tank tops (3 for 100 pa yung iba), shorts, foot socks, belts, a pair of shoes saka earrings--na tig-lilimang piso ang isang pares.

Inabot sila ng tanghalian kaya nag-decide sila na dun na rin kumain sa palengke.

 

First time ni Dama na makatikim ng pancit canton na nasa isang malaking platter tapos kikiam ang lahok. At syempre pa, pera nya yung ipinambayad nila. Saklap.

Pagkatapos nilang kumain, nagkaayaan ang magbabarkada na bumili ng identical wristbands para sa kanila. At dahil si Dama ang magbabayad--sya ang namili ng kulay.

Purple.

"Ang cute!" Eula exclaimed.

"Kaso purple... tss." Reklamo ni Keeme.

"O? May angal? Eh di hubadin mo!" Naiiritang sabi ni Dama.

 

"Biro lang! Palagi ka namang high blood!"

"Don't say bad things about purple!"

"Don't say bad things about purple! Bleehck!" Nasusuyang pang-gagaya ni Keeme sa sinabi nya. "Dami mong arte."

"Ano? Mag-aaway na naman? Pahi-pahinga din." Eli said.

"Oo nga. Saka yung nomo natin. Ano na? May pera ka ba?" Tanong ni Lei kay Dama.

"Anla! Bat ako lang? Hindi kayo aambag? Aba aba--pakapalan ng mukha?"

"Sus. Dami pang reklamo. Zelo ano na?" Sumahod si Lei kay Zelo.

 

Binigyan sya nito ng 500. "O... pass muna ako."

"Bakit?" Sabay-sabay nilang tanong.

"Di ako pinayagan eh." Napakamot si Zelo.

"Ba yang nililigawan mo? Makapagbawal naman--girlfriend?"

 

Nagulat si Dama. Di kase nya sukat akalain na nagkakagusto pala sa babae itong si Zelo. Lalong di nya lubos maisip na may nagpapaligaw dito.

"May niliigawan ka?" Tanong nya dito.

"Di mo alam? Ano'ng klase kang pinsan?" Tanong naman sa kanya ni Eula.

"Eh hindi naman kami close. Saka haller... makapambulyaw naman kase yan..." Sagot nya sabay irap kay Zelo.

 

"Deserving ka naman sa pambubulyaw ko pinsan." Nakangiting sabi ni Zelo sa kanya sabay akbay. Inis na pinalis yun ni Dama.

"Iniisip ko pa lang na pinsan kita, nasusuka na 'ko."

"Ako nga nasuka na eh." Ganting sagot naman ni Zelo.

 

Nagtawanan sina Lei.

"Ang arte nyo! Magpinsan nga kayo!"

With that remark, nag-irapan ang dalawa. Ni civilized citizens nga, hindi nila ma-portray tapos bumebenta pala sa mga kabarkada ang acting nilang magpinsan sila?

 

"Ano Zelo? Di ka talaga sasama?"

Umiling si Zelo. "Baka magalit eh."

"Sus! Taob!"

"Ganyan talaga... hayaan nyo na."

"Sabihin mo naman kay Tassie sagutin ka na. Aba eh last year ka pa nanliligaw dun ah?"

"Hayaan nyo... darating din sya dyan."

 

"Sana di ka sagutin. Karma mo na sa pag-aaway sa 'kin." Remarks naman ni Dama sabay belat.

Itinaas ni Zelo ang dalawang kamay at inilapit sa mukha ni Dama. Tapos ayun--SPLAT. Parang papatay lang ng lamok si Zelo pero imbis na lamok ang pisutin--eh yung pisngi ng pinsan ang napagdiskitahan.

Nginitian nya ng pagkatamis-tamis si Dama.

 

"Kapag ikaw nagdilang-anghel... humanda ka sa 'kin."

 

xxxxx

AN: Sorry sa sabaw na UD. Dinaldal kase ako ng mga kasama ko sa bahay kaya hindi ako nakapag-isip ng matino. Haha... bukas ulit! May picture ng wristbands nila kaso nasa group ko sa FB.

Yun lang... good night! ^^

*******************************************
[9] Chapter 8
*******************************************
Hated by many, confronted by none.

--

Hindi na nga nakasama si Zelo sa inuman pero masaya pa rin ang lima kahit sila -sila lang. Ang lakas palang uminom ni Eula. Akala ni Dama ay kaunahan itong aayaw pero ito pa ang may pinaka-maraming tagay.

Si Keeme, ang tanggero, ay pilit nilalasing si Lei. Nalaman ni Dama na bumabait si Lei kapag lasing kaya ginagawa ni Keeme yun. Nauutangan pa nga raw ito. Si Eli ang mahinang uminom at puro pulutan ang nilalantakan.

 

First time ni Dama na uminom out of a shot glass na pinagpapasa-pasahan. Sanay kase sya na red wine lang ang iniinom. Minsan white wine. Minsan champagne. Kaya palaging sa wine glass. Kung shots man, kanya-kanya sila ng mga kainuman niya.

 

Napapangiwi sya sa tuwing papasahan siya ni Keeme ng isang shot ng tequila. Wala naman kase silang sliced lemons eh. Iced tea lang na tig-sasampung piso ang chaser nila.

Ang mga pulutan, tig-sasampung pisong chichiria lang.

 

Pero masaya sya. For the first time in her life, she felt like she truly belonged to a group. 

 

--

 

Hindi namalayan ni Dama na dalawang linggo na pala ang lumipas mula noong unang lipat niya sa bahay nina Zelo. Nothing much has changed since then. She was still mean. She was still bitchy. Tamad pa rin sya at sumasagot-sagot sa mga matatanda.

Nandidiri pa rin sya sa mga pagkain sa karinderya at hindi pa rin sya gumagawa sa bahay.

Change takes time and two weeks is not enough to straighten her manner.

Pero may isang bagay na nagbago sa kanya.

 

Maaga na syang gumising.

 

At 6am, she would get up from the bed and sit at the living room to wait for her breakfast. Nakatunganga lang sya doon habang pinapanuod ang kawawang matanda sa pagkukumahog sa pag-iintindi sa nakababatang anak at sa paghahanda ng almusal.

Nadala na kase si Dama dahil isang linggo--straight--tuwing umaga, nagigising sya sa buhos ng tubig ng pinsan nya sa mukha nya.

There's this one time na bumili pa pala si Zelo ng yelo mula sa kapitbahay at binabaran yung tubig na ibubuhos nito sa mukha nya. Ayun, mangiyak-ngiyak sya sa lamig.

Kaya naman pinilit nya talagang unahan ang pinsan sa paggising. One time nga, nagising sya ng 4:30 sa sobrang pagka-paranoid na tanghaliin sya ng gising. She took the opportunity para gumanti.

Wala namang nagawa si Manang Pacing dahil kasalukuyan itong bumibili ng pandesal. Dama took the dipper saka yun pinuno ng tubig at walang anu-ano'y ibinuhos sa mukha ni Zelo.

Napapitlag ang binata at ke aga-aga'y nagmumura.

 

Tatawa-tawa lang noon si Dama.

 

Sa inis ni Zelo, inagaw nya yung tabo sa dalaga at ipinukpok sa ulo nito. At dun na nagsimula ang isa pang maagang pag-aaway na nakagising sa ilang kapitbahay.

Napagalitan tuloy ang dalawa hindi lang ni Manang Pacing kundi pati na rin ng mga kapitbahay.

 

--

 

Hindi na rin sumasabay si Dama kay Zelo dahil madalas itong nauuna para sunduin ang nililigawan nito. Si Dama ni Eli ang madalas magkasabay--pwera ngayon dahil mali-late daw ito at pinauna na sya.

Pagdating niya sa usual nilang hintayan, naabutan nya si Eula na nag-aayos na naman sa ilalim ng punong mangga. Lalapitan na sana nya ito ng biglang may umuna sa kanya. Tatlong babae na pare-pareho ng style ng bag ang lumapit kay Eula.

Based on Eula's expression, Dama guessed na kakilala nito ang mga lumapit. She was about to turn and walk to their classroom instead ng makita nyang hinablot ng isa ang press powder ni Eula at ibinato iyon.

Immediately, she rushed off to help Eula.

 

"Feelingera ka rin eh no? Hindi ka na nakuntento sa boyfriend ko na inagaw mo dati--ngayon naman pati boyfriend ni Nicole?" Narinig nyang sabi ng nasa gitna.

"I don't know what you're talking about." Eula replied blandly.

The third girl scoffed. "Yeah right! Kami pa talaga ang lolokohin mo Eula? We WERE friends remember? Kaya alam na namin kung gaano ka kakati!"

"Kung sila nauuto mo, pwes kami hindi! For all we know, baka nga lahat ng lalaki dito sa campus, nakagalaw na sa 'yo eh." 

Nagpanting ang tenga ni Dama sa narinig.

 

Clenching her fists, she walked towards them. Pinagitnaan niya sila.

"Hoy babae... you didn't tell me na nagha-hire ka na pala ng P.A? May ire-refer pa naman sana ako sa 'yo." She said to Eula.

"D-Dama."

Dama looked at the girls. "In fairness naman sa inyo, mga mukha talaga kayong P.A."

"Hoy miss! Magdahan-dahan ka sa pananalita mo ha!"

Dama crossed her arms. "Why? Am I talking too fast that your slow brain cannot comprehend on what I'm saying? Gaano ba kabagal mag-process yang utak mo? Turtle pace?" Dere-deretso nyang tanong.

"Ang yabang mo ah! And how dare you say na pangit kami?!" Paghuhurmentado ng nasa gitna.

"Excuse me, wala akong sinabing pangit kayo--although you are. But good on you for concluding right." She smiled and turned to Eula. "You should pick this one. Kahit papano nag-iisip sya."

"Pakialamera kang masyado ah!" The first girl tried to slap Dama pero madali nya iyong naharang. Ilang beses na ba syang nasampal ng mommy nya? Nadala na sya dahil masakit sa pisngi. Kaya naman she practiced on girls at school--sampalan lang. Minsan naman, mga katulong ang pinag-papractisan nya.

She'd ask them to hit her. And if they did--they're fired.

 

"Kasalanan nyo, tropa ko yung binabangga nyo." She replied calmly saka sinampal ang babae gamit ang isa nyang kamay.

Dahil sa ginawa nya, nagalit yung dalawang kasama ng babae at sinabunutan sya. Si Eula na pinilit syang tulungan--ayun, nasabunutan din.

Mabuti na nga lang at dumating sina Keeme at Lei na mga dakilang warfreak. The girls, realizing that they are outnumbered, quickly retreated.

 

Dama smiled triumphantly at Eula. Pareho silang mukha ng sabukot but she was beaming. For the first time in her life... she fought for someone other than herself. And it felt ten times better than when she's fighting for herself alone.

Para bang nagkaroon ng saysay.

"No need to thank me. I just feel like being bitchy today." She said to her.

"Bakit ba masyado kang pakialamera?" Sagot nito sa kanya. "Hindi ko kailangan ng tulong mo! Pwede ba--next time, mind your own business? sawsawera ka masyado eh!" 

Pagkasabi ni Eula noon ay umalis na ito. Sumunod naman si Lei sa kapatid. Naiwan sila ni Keeme sa may puno ng mangga.

Hindi rin malaman ni Keeme ang gagawin.

 

Sya naman--nagulat. Of all the ways of saying thanks--this is how she was repaid?

 

Parang may kumirot bigla sa puso nya. Unang beses--unang beses nyang magpakita ng malasakit sa tao...

This is the very first time she showed someone that she cares... ito pa ba? Ito pa ba ang makukuha nyang kapalit?

Unable to take it, she stormed out of the school and went back home.

 

Agad na naging concerned si Manang Pacing ng makita ang dalaga na umiiyak. Ayaw na ayaw nito ng umiiyak. Lalo na sa harap ng mommy nito. Ayaw na ayaw ni Dama na nakikita ng ibang tao na mahina sya.

She always wear this mask of strength to show people na hindi sya pwedeng basta-bastahin. Na hindi sya pwedeng apak-apakan.

Sinundan ng matanda si Dama sa kwarto at hinagod-hagod ang likod nito.

"Anak... bakit ka umiiyak?"

 

Matagal na humagulgol si Dama bago sya nakasagot.

"Yaya bakit ganun? Gusto ko lang naman syang tulungan ah? Masama na palang tumulong sa kaibigan? Kasalanan ko pa pala?"

"Ano ba'ng nangyari?"

"Si Eula kase! Sya na nga ang tinutulungan, ako pa inaway nya!"

Napangiti ang matanda.

 

Bagong-bago sa pandinig nito ang hinaing na iyon ni Dama. Lahat ng katulong sa mansion ay pagod na sa karirinig sa reklamo ng dalaga. Pero lahat ng iyon ay para sa sarili lamang nito. She didn't care about anyone else.

Ngayon lang.

"Baka naman kase hindi nya kailangan ng tulong anak?"

"Are you kidding me?! Eh muntikan na ngang magkabasag-basag ang mukha nya kanina eh! If you could only hear the things they said about her--it's horrible! I had to help!"

Manang Pacing held her face and brushed her tears away with her hands.

"Hindi lahat ng tao ay kayang aminin na mahina sila. Minsan, gusto nilang lumaban ng mag-isa para mapatunayan sa sarili nila na kaya nila. Pero hindi ibig sabihin na hindi nila tanggap ang tulong na ibinibigay mo."

"Manang, unang beses kong tumulong sa ibang tao and this is what I'd get? Kung ganito rin lang naman eh di fine--hindi na lang ako magmamalasakit!"

Napabuntong-hininga ang matanda.

"Anak, 'wag kang ganyan. Hindi porket nagkamali ka na sa unang beses ay susuko ka na. Siguro nadala lang sya ng galit kaya may nasabi syang hindi maganda. Palipasin mo lang ng konti at sigurado akong magkakaayos din kayo."

"Sana nga yaya..."

 

Sa maikling panahon pa nga lang ay sanay na sanay na sya sa kanila. She was so familiar with them na para bang nakatadhana silang maging magkakaibigan. Kaya siguro hindi nya matanggap na ang simpleng pagtulong nya pa ang pagmumulan ng away nila.

Kung iba sigurong tao yun ay madali nyang mapapalampas....

 

Pero kaibigan nya yun eh.

 

Isa sa mga una nyang kaibigan... at baka isa na rin sa mga tanging tao na magtityagang makipagkaibigan sa kanya. Kung masisira lang yun agad... parang ang hirap bumalik sa dati. Yung wala syang kasangga.

Yung wala syang kausap.

Yung wala syang karamay.

 

Si Zelo... kahit madalas pa sa numero ng orasan sila kung mag-away, aminado naman sya na mabait na rin ito sa kanya. Well... slight.

Si Lei... kahit mahilig itong mambara at mang-away sa kanya, kapag may iba namang umaaway sa kanya... iginaganti sya nito.

Si Keeme, kahit may pagka-basag-ulero at walang kwentang estudyante, pipilitin ka nyang pangitiin kapag malungkot ka.

Si Eula, sweet sya at maalalahanin. Kaya hindi sya naniniwala sa mga kwento na ikinakalat ng mga dati nitong kaibigan tungkol dito. Mabait si Eula... so much though that she doesn't fight back most of the time.

At si Eli... kahit may pagka-engot yun... hinding-hindi sya iniwan noon sa ere. Kapag gagabihin sya ng uwi, ito na mismo ang naghihintay para sa kanya.

 

Those little things that may be nothing to anyone else, meant everything to her. Dahil sa maliliit na bagay na iyon.... she discovered something new about herself.

 

 

 

She really does have a heart... underneath all that hatred... she's just like everybody else.

 

 

She needs love.

xxxxx

AN: Sorry... wala munang Zelo... nanliligaw eh. Hahaha... matagal pa si Pierre! ^^

Me, weird? Bitch--I'm limited edition.

--


"Dylan, where's mommy?" Danny asked his son. Kasalukuyan itong nakalupagi sa sahig,  naglalaro ng chess mag-isa habang nakaharap sa glass wall ng kwarto nito. May isa kaseng pader ng kwarto nito na mula ceiling hanggang sa floor ay salamin. Para nga naman hindi na nya kailangang magpalagay ng mirror sa kwarto nya.

Dun nya trip palagi na maglaro ng chess--kalaban ang sarili nya.

"Mom told me not to tell you." Sagot nito sa ama.

Kumunot ang noo ni Dani. "Why not?"

The kid sighed saka tumingala sa ama.

"She's been crying pa. She misses ate."

"Where is she then?"

Nag-alangan si Dylan.

"Come on son, tell me..."

"West wing pa... sa ballet room."

Tinanguan ni Dani ang anak at saka sya nagtungo sa ballet room. It's the most unused room at the house. Wala naman kaseng sumasayaw sa pamilya nila kundi si Dama. Meg wanted her daughter to be a brilliant ballerina kaya simula pagkabata ay pinagti-take nya na ito ng ballet lessons.

Nahinto lang iyon ng maging teenager ito. Mas ginusto na kase nito ang mag-shopping at mang-alipusta ng kapwa.

Meg loves dancing... kaya sa ginawa ng anak ay hindi nya naiwasan ang magtampo.

 

--

 

Naabutan ni Dani ang asawa na inaayos ang tutu na sinusuot ni Dama noong maliit pa lang ito. Nakaupo si Megan sa sahig--umiiyak. Something tugged at the heart of her husband... who rarely sees her cry. Ngayon lang ulit ito umiyak....

"Ma..." Nilapitan niya ang asawa at niyakap.

"D-Dad!" Halatang nagulat si Meg ng mapansin na nasa likuran na nya ang asawa. She brushed her tears away. "I-I was just... ano kase... na-irritate yung mata ko. Maalikabok na kase 'to." She pretended to brush the imaginary dirt off the tutu.

Dani smiled and kissed her hair. "Stop lying to me. I know you're missing her."

Naitulak ni Meg ang asawa. "No! Of course not! Why would I miss her? Mas masaya nga dito sa bahay kung wala sya eh... walang maarte!"

"Bakit defensive ka masyado?" Taas-kilay na tanong ni Dani.

"Hindi kaya!" She replied in an obviously high-pitched, defensive tone.

"Sure ka mommy?"

"I am sure! 'Wag ka ngang gumawa ng issue dad. I'm not missing her."

 

Dani sighed.

"So I'm sure you don't want to hear about what she's doing, right?"

"No."

"Uh--okay." He shrugged then stood up. Naglakad si Dani palabas ng ballet room but before he exits, he turned to his wife, smiled and said:

"She's doing fine Meg. Don't worry too much. She's stronger than you think." 

When he was finally out of the room... saka lang nakangiti si Megan.

 

--

 

"Ouch--" Nakagat na naman ni Dama ang dila. Pangatlong beses na 'to ngayong araw ah? Ano'ng problema ng bibig nya?

"Wow... mukhang madaming nakakaalala sa 'yo wah?" Nakangiting puna ni Eli.

Nagla-lunch sila sa kubo. Kanina pa naha-high blood si Dama dahil halos magsugat na ang dila nya kakakagat.

"Tsk. May ganun-ganun ka pang nalalaman."

"Baka namimiss ka na ni Eula?"

Umirap si Dama sa kanya. Silang dalawa lang kase ni Eli ang sabay kumain. Si Zelo... nandun sa nililigawan nya. Sina Keeme at Lei naman, syempre hindi maiwan si Eula.

Pero hindi sila magkakaaway. Sadyang nahahati lang talaga ang grupo para walang naiiwang mag-isa. Syempre nga naman, ayaw nilang may nali-left out na isa sa kanila.

"Ewan ko sa kanya." 

 

Nagtatampo pa rin si Dama dahil tatlong araw na syang hindi kinakausap ni Eula. Minsan nga nagkakabungguan na sila dahil sa pagtutulak ng mga kabarkada pero wala pa rin talaga.

Ang alam nya galit pa rin si Eula sa kanya kahit na wala naman syang ginagawang masama dito. Hindi nga nya maintindihan kung ano ba'ng problema and frankly... nagsisimula na rin syang mainis.

She continued eating.

 

"Dama." Eli nudged her. Natangko tuloy yung kinakain nya.

"Tss. Ano?!"

Eli motioned to her right. Tumingala s Dama sa bandang kanan niya. Nakatayo dun si Eula--hindi makatingin sa kanya ng deretso.

Dama chose to snob her.

"Una na 'ko ha?" Paalam ni Eli sa kanila.

"Whatever." She replied.

 

Nang makaalis ang Eli, agad na naupo si Eula sa tabi nya.

"Uy..."

Dama ignored her.

"Sorry na."

Hindi nya pa rin ito pinansin.

Eula nudged her. Nabitawan tuloy ni Dama yung kutsara na may lamang isang subo ng giniling at kanin.

"Ano ba? Masama na ba'ng kumain ng matiwasay ngayon?!"

Eula pouted. "Di ka kase namamansin eh."

Pinanlisikan nya ito ng mata. "Ako pa talaga ang hindi namamansin ha?"

Nagyuko ng ulo si Eula. "Nahihiya kase ako sa 'yo eh."

"Eh bakit nandito ka? Alis!" She pushed her. "Magsama kayo ng hiya mo!"

"Aray naman!" Reklamo ni Eula. "Pwede namang magtaray ng hindi nananakit di ba?"

"Sa naiinis ako sa 'yo eh!"

"Kaya nga humihingi ng tawad eh!" Eula rolled her eyes.

"Humihingi ka ng tawad? Try mo sa palengke."

"Grabe 'to." Naiinis na tumayo si Eula.

 

"Ano suko ka naman agad?" Pahabol ni Dama. Napailing na lang si Eula at muling nilingon ang kaibigan.

"Ang arte mo!" She exclaimed.

"So? May karapatan akong mag-inarte kase maganda ako."

"Ay ganun? Kaya pala ang arte ko." Eula flipped her hair. Napataas naman ng kilay si Dama sa sinabi nito.

"Ang feeling ha?"

Naupo ito sa tabi nya. "Kaya nga nagkakasundo tayo di ba? Kase pareho tayong maarte." Nakangiti nitong sabi sa kanya.

"Kaso yung arte mo--arteng pangkatulong." Nakagising sagot ni Dama.

"Ang bitch bitch mo talaga!"

"Para masaya. Anyway--" She looked at her unfinished food. Nadumihan na rin ang kutsara na ginagamit nya kaya hindi sya makapagpatuloy ng pagkain. "Bilhan mo 'ko ng pagkain."

"Ayoko nga!"

"Dali na! Ginulo mo yung pagkain ko eh!"

Napabuntong-hininga ng malalim si Eula. "Fine! half-rice lang ha!"

"Kuripot nito! One rice na! Saka bili ka rin ng dessert!" Pagpupumilit ni Dama.

"PG lang teh? 'Kay fine... basta okay na tayo ah?" Paninigurado ni Eula.

"Pagkatapos kong kumain--we'll see."

"May we'll see pa? O sya... wag na. Magkaaway na lang ulit tayo."

Dama rolled her eyes. "Joke lang... 'to naman!"

 

"Naks... bati na sila!"

"Buo na ulit tayo!"

"Ang aarte eh. Pinaabot pa ng 3 days tapos magbabati lang pala?"

 

Nagsiupo sna Keeme, Eli at Lei sa dati nilang pwesto sa kubo.

"Gusto nyo ng ice cream? Ililibre tayo ni Eula ngayon." Nakangising sabi ni Dama sa tatlo.

"Hoy! Ano'ng libre? Wala akong pera no!"

"'To naman... minsan lang eh."

"KKB. 'Wag kayong magpaka-hampaslupa." Eula said in finality saka ito tumayo at lumapit sa lalagyanan ng mga pagkain para bumili ng pinapabili ni Dama.

Naiwan ang apat sa table na nagkikwentuhan ng biglang dumating si Zelo... kasama si Tassie.
 

 

"Hi Tass." Bati nila sa dalaga. Tassie smiled and waved at them. Si Dama--being the only one na hindi pa kilala si Tassie, felt a little left out.

"Ah... Tassie.... pinsan ko nga pala, si Dama. Pinsan... si Tassie." Pakilala sa kanila ni Zelo.

Pinagtaasan ni Dama ng kilay ang binata. Ang bait-bait naman yata nito ngayon at nakuha pa talagang ngumiti? She wanted to scream fake at his face kaya lang baka awayin na naman sya nito pag-uwi.

She simply smiled at the girl na pinaupo ni Zelo sa tabi ni Lei. Si Zelo naman ay naupo sa tabi ni Dama. She guessed na ayaw nitong patabihin sa kanya yung nililigawan nito kase baka nga naman mahawa ng sama ng ugali nya.

LOL. Pwede bang i-Blutooth ang bitchiness?

 

"Hey Tassie... can I ask you a question?" Tanong ni Dama sa dalaga.

"Sure." Nakangiti nitog sagot.

Dama felt Zelo's silent glare boring at her right cheek. Pero keri lang... wala naman itong magagawa dahil nandito yung nililigawan nya.

"Magkakagusto ka ba sa lalaking naninigaw ng babae?"

Kumunot ang noo ni Tassie. "Ha? Uh--siguro hindi. Ayoko ng sinisigawan ako eh. I mean--hindi naman ako bingi?" Sagot nito sabay tawa.

"Eh yung lalaking nambubuhos ng tubig sa mukha ng tulog?"

 

"Siguro hindi."

Napamura ng mahina si Dama ng maramdaman nya ang paa ng pinsan na dumidiin sa sapatos niya.

"Ah... last--eh yung lalaking nananapak sa sapatos ng babae?"

Agad inilayo ni Zelo ang paa kay Dama.

"No." Tassie laughed. Saka ito bumaling kay Zelo. "Ang weird ng pinsan mo Zelo!"

 

"I'm not weird. I'm limited edition." She said to her.

 

"Baka extinct." Sabat naman ni Zelo. 

Nagtawanan ang mga kabarkada nila... pati si Tassie nakikitawa rin. Pagdating ni Eula, kusang umisod si Tassie para paupuin ito.

While looking at her, isa lang ang naaalala ni Dama. That angelic face... that weird kindness... that happy smile...

Parang ang tita Angel niya.

 

--

 

"Achu!" Napasinghot bigla si Angel, who was currently on the plane--with her husband--on her way back to the Philippines.

"Mama what's wrong?"

She shook her head. "Nabahing lang ako papa."

Ngumiti si Enzo. "Baka naman may nakakaalala sa 'yo?"

Angel's eyebrows furrowed worriedly. "Baka naman hinahanap na 'ko ni Anzo? I told you papa... dapat isinama na natin sya pauwi."

Hinawakan ni Enzo ang kamay ni Angel. "Mama, don't worry. I'm sure nag-eenjoy yun na mag-isa sa Japan. Saka ayaw nyang sumama di ba?"

"Hmmm... sabagay. But I'll call him after we land--just to make sure that he's okay." Nakangiti nyang sagot sa asawa.

 

--

 

Somewhere in Japan...

"Achu!" 

 

xxxxx

AN: Namiss nyo ba sila? Namimiss ko na din sila eh... pero EXTRA lang po sila sa kwentong ito at minsan lang susulpot. Hehe... Saka sa mga nagsasabing si ZELO at PIERRE ay iisa... baka naman nagkakamali kayo? Remember... walang nanay si Pierre? ^^ Saka sa bandang huli pa lalabas si Pierre... ganito kase... uh--parang sa chapter ng buhay na'to ni Dama ay hindi sya kasali. So si Zelo ang nasa kwento. Pero hindi porket bagay sila ni Dama eh sila na talaga.. may mga bagay lang na akala mo yun na pero hindi pa pala.

Magulo ba? Hehe... basta. Anyway, ang ganda kaya ni Tassie. CLICK THE EXTERNAL LINK if you are curious about her physicality. :p

Yun lang! COMMENT NAMAN KAYO OH ^^

Automatikong napalingon ang magbabarkada sa tumawag kay Lei. They knew all too well how she would react with that. Mas mabuti pang tawagin itong pangit kesa sa nerd. Dama had been wondering about that since their little encounter a few weeks ago.

Tingin nya, ngayon nya malalaman ang sagot sa tanong nyang yun.

 

They saw a guy smiled and waved at Lei. Contrary to what they were expecting, nanatiling nakaupo si Lei at pilit na nginitian ang lalaki.

Hindi ito sumugod para awayin ang lalaking tumawag sa kanya ng nerd. Ni parang hindi man lang ito nagalit dito.

 

Pagkaalis ng lalaki ay agad na tinabihan ni Keeme si Lei at inakbayan.

"Uy nerd!" Ngumiti ito ng nakakaloko sa kaibigan. Agad itong pinanlisikan ng mata ni Lei saka sinuntok sa tiyan.

"Di ba kabilin-bilinan kong 'wag akong tatawagin ng ganun? Naghahanap ka talaga ng sakit ng katawan noh?!" Halos pasigaw nitong sabi.

Napahawak sa sikmura Keeme. "Arayko... bakit kapag ako, nagagalit ka ha?"

"Oo nga." Hindi napigilang sumabat ni Dama. "Bakit kapag kami, hindi okay na tawagin kang nerd? Who the hell is that guy to be an exception?"

 

"Ex nya."

Napanganga ang lahat sa sagot ni Eula.

"WEH?" Halos sabay-sabay nilang tanong.

"Yolanda!" Sigaw naman ni Lei sa kapatid. 

Pinandilatan ni Eula ng mata si Lei. "Ate! Di ba sabi ko 'wag mo 'kong tatawagin ng ganyan?"

"Eh ikaw kase!" Lei retorted.

 

"Teka teka..." Awat ni Eli sa magkapatid. Tapos ay bumaling ito kay Eula. "Explain."

Eula sighed. "Yun si Jeric. Boyfriend ni ate since first year high school hanggang after grad. Di pa rin yata yan nakaka-move on dun eh." Tumingin ito kay Lei.

"Luh--tagal na ah! Hangover ka pa rin sa gagong yun?" Gulat na tanong ni Keeme.

"I honestly didn't expect that you've had a boyfriend." Dama said.

"Bakit hindi ka man lang nagkwento?" Tanong naman ni Zelo sa kanya.

Isa-isa silang sinukat ng tingin ni Lei. Tapos ay kumunot ang noo nito. "At bakit ko naman ikikwento yun sa inyo? Wala na yun. Matagal na yun eh."

"Ows? Eh bat parang affected ka pa rin?" Dama looked skeptic.

 

"Mukha lang akong affected pero wala na talaga yun sa 'kin." Tumayo si Lei. "Tara mag-cutting?" Aya nito sa kanila.

"Ha? At san naman tayo pupunta?"

"Gagala!" Nakangiti nitong sagot. "Tara dali! Tinatamad akong mag-aral ngayon."

 

Nagkatinginan na lamang ang magkakaibigan na sumunod sa kanya palabas ng school.  Tinatamad din kase silang mag-aral eh. Kaya kapag may isang nagyaya at wala sa mood mag-aral ang lahat... eh di go.

Sumakay sila ng jeep at nagpunta sa pinakamalapit at pinakamaliit na mall na napuntahan ni Dama. Dalawang palapag lang yung building at kaya mo ng maikot in less than an hour.

Dumeretso sila sa Time Zone kung saan nag-rent ng karaoke si Lei at nagbabanat ng kanta.

 

"Oo nga. Mukha ngang di sya affected." Naiiling na sabi ni Dama kay Eula.

"Tss. Asa ka naman dyan. Eh hanggang ngayon nga stalker pa rin sya ng lalaking yun sa Facebook eh."

"YOLANDA!!!" Lei shrieked. Napatakip silang lahat ng tenga.

"Ano ba ate!"

"Ikaw naman ang kumanta." Nakangiting iniabot ni Lei ang mic sa kapatid.

"Ayoko!"

"Ako na lang!" Inagaw ni Dama yung mic mula kay Lei. "Kung di nyo naitatanong eh... nagmana ako ng dancing skills ko sa mommy ko. And my great vocals are from my dad." She preambled.

Nagpalakpakan sina Keeme at Eli while Zelo was trying his best not to smile.

Nagsimula na ang tugtog kaya't nagsimula na ring kumanta si Dama.

 

Okay naman sa bandang simula eh. Understandable naman na medyo nagki-quiver pa yung boses sa una kase hindi naman sya professional singer to start with. Kaso nung umabot na sa chorus....

"Don't make me.... CLOSE ONE MORE DOO--"





Inagaw ni Keeme ang mic from Dama.

"Punyeta! Mag-sorry ka sa tenga ko!" Naiirita nitong sabi.

"Ano ba!" Pinilit agawin ni Dama ang mic from Keeme. "Di pa ako tapos kumanta!"

"Wag na wag nyong ibibigay ang mic dyan!" Pakiusap ni Eli, who was looking pale from all that singing.

Napadabog si Dama. "Ang sasama nyo!"

"Tanggapin mo na lang kase na wala kang talent sa pagkanta!"

"Are you guys deaf?" Dama asked them--shocked. Eh kase naman, kapag kumakanta sya sa karaoke room nila sa bahay kasama ang mga katulong eh wala namang nagrereklamo.

Little did she know na wala talagang magrereklamo sa takot na sisantehin nya ang mga ito.

 

Pero iba kase kapag kaibigan eh... walang preno ang panlalait sa'yo.

 

"Mag-inom na nga lang tayo! Nakakabadtrip 'tong si Dama eh!" Aya na naman ni Lei sa kanila. She was already leaving the karaoke room kaya nagsitayo na rin sila para sundan sya.

"Inom naman ngayon? Umamin ka nga, bothered ka sa lalaking yun noh?" Puna ni Dama.

"'Wag kang magmura dyan. Uhaw lang ako."

"Eh di uminom ka ng tubig!"

"Sa alak ako uhaw." Nag-iwas ng tingin si Lei. "Kung ayaw nyong sumama, eh di 'wag."

 

Pero syempre, nagsisunudan pa rin sila. Sa bahay nina Lei sila dumeretso. Wala pang tao kase parehong nasa trabaho ang mga magulang nila. Bumili ng alak sa tindahan sina Lei, Keeme at Zelo habang naiwan naman sina Eula sa bahay.

"Euls, sino ba yung lalaki kanina?" Tanong ni Eli.

"Ex nga ni ate. Si Jeric."

"Why did they break up?" Tanong naman ni Dama.

Eula shrugged. "Ewan ko. Basta isang araw, umuwi na lang si ate na umiiyak eh. Because of that guy, hindi na tumuloy ng pagkuha ng entrance exam sa UP si ate kaya dito na lang sya nag-aral. Ang masaklap pa dun, dito din nag-aral si Jeric. Kaya ayun... halos araw-araw silang nagkikita."

"Sya ba yung nagpauso ng nerd?" Tanong ulit ni Eli.

Tumango si Eula. "Kaya nga galit na galit si ate kapag may ibang tumatawag sa kanya ng nerd eh. Naaalala nya kase yung ex nya."

"Hindi pa ba sya nakakaget-over? Mygosh! Clingy much sa old feelings!"

 

Inilagay ni Eula sa tabi yung tinimpla nyang chaser. "Hindi ka pa kase siguro naiinlove kaya hindi mo maimagine yung ganun."

"Hindi talaga! At hinding-hindi ko gugustuhing mainlove no!" Nasusuyang sagot ni Dama.

"Luh--sige magsalita ka ng tapos! Mamukat-mukat mo, bukas inlove ka na." Natatawang sabi ni Eli.

"Hoy Elijah! 'Wag ka ngang magmura dyan!" Inis na sabi dito ng dalaga.

 

Pagmumura kase ang pet name nila sa love or anything na related dito. Kaya kapag pinag-uusapan nila ang tungkol dun--they refer to it as pagmumura.

 

Maya-maya pa'y dumating ang tatlo pa nilang kabarkada at pagka-settle ng lahat, pumwesto na sila sa likod bahay at nag-inuman.

 

Pagkatapos ng inuman, nag-antay muna sila ng gabi at nagpahulas. Kase nga naman, masamang tingnan sa estudyante yung nag-cutting class na nga eh nag-inuman pa--ng naka-uniform!

Dun pa sila kumain ng hapunan kina Lei.

Laking pasasalamat pa ni Dama at nakatikim sya ng masarap na ulam. May kaya kase ang pamilya nina Lei kaya sagana sila sa karne... di tulad nina Zelo na madalas isda at gulay ang ulam.

 

"Oy una na 'ko ha?" Paalam ni Eli ng mapatapat sila sa bahay nito.

"Wag muna! Bata ka pa!" Biro ni Dama.

Tumawa ng bahagya si Eli at ginulo ang buhok ni Dama. Saka ito pumasok ng bahay nila.

 

"Tss. Ginulo pa talaga buhok ko eh." She was fixing her hair ng mapansin niya ang pinsan--ang lapad lapad ng ngiti nito na para bang may magandang nangyari. "Why are you smiling?"

Agad nawala ang ngiti nito. "Ayan hindi na."

"Problema mo? Parang nagtatanong lang eh."

 

--

 

Bahay. 2:08 am. Nagising na naman si Dama dahil sobrang init at pangangati ang likod nya. Lumabas sya ng kwarto para uminom ng tubig. Natural na makikita nya ang mag-ina na natutulog sa sala.

She didn't even know what she was thinking when she walked towards them. Naupo sya sa tabi ni Zelo at pinagmasdan ng maigi ang pinsan. Parang ang saya-saya pa rin nito dahil kahit hanggang sa pagtulog ay nakangiti ito.

May nangyari kayang maganda?

 

She didn't know why... but on that particular morning... she actually found him--well, for the lack of a better adjective--mesmerizing.

Gwapo pala ito... kahit may pagkamasungit at isnabero.

 

Dapat kase palagi kang ngingiti ng ganyan para hindi ka mukhang nakakatakot, she thought.

Tumayo na sya at akmang hahakbang papuntang kusina when she heard him speak.

 

"Dama..."

 

Thinking that he was awake, she frantically thought of a good excuse kung bakit nandun sya sa tabi nito at nakatitig sa binata.

Nilingon nya ito. "A-Ah... kase--" She stopped on track ng makitang natutulog pa rin ito.

 

Was he playing games with her?

Gising kaya talaga ito at nagkukunwari lang tulog?

Or was he really just sleep-talking?

 

Kahit ano pa man iyon, sa di malamang kadahilanan... napahawak si Dama sa dibdib nya ng may maramdaman syang kakaiba...

Her heart suddenly went erratic.

 

 

 

Dugdugdugdugdug.

Napangiti si Dama ng magising siya kinabukasan.

 

Panaginip lang pala lahat ng yun... salamat naman.




Nag-inat-inat muna siya bago bumangon. Pagkalabas nya ng kwarto, impis na yung hinigaan ni Manang at ni Zelo. Mukhang nakapasok na rin si Meera sa school.

Naabutan nya si Manang Pacing na ipinaghahanda sya ng makakain.

"Good morning anak. Kain ka na." Nakangiti nitong aya sa kanya.

Naupo siya sa hapag kainan.

"Nasan si Zelo?" Nagtaka sya bigla dahil wala ang pinsan. Usually sabay silang nag-aagahan eh.

"Nauna ng pumasok, may dadaanan pa raw sya." Sagot ng matanda.

"Okay." She shrugged and ate her food.

 

--

 

School...

Nawawala na naman si Zelo sa barkada kaya hindi maiwasan ni Dama ang maghanap.

"Si Zelo?" Tanong nya sa mga kaibigan.

"Nandun sa HRM building." Sagot ni Lei sa kanya.

"Ah..." She was mildly surprised na nakalimutan nyang may nililigawan nga pala ito. Si Tassie... the perfect girl. The one she could never beat kahit pa handicapped ito.

 

Why am I even thinking of beating her?, she thougt.

 

 --

 

Lunch.

Wala pa rin si Zelo. Sumulpot lang ito kanina sa klase pero nawala din ito kaagad nung lunch break na. At ngayon nga, kulang na naman sila.

Dama ate in silence. Nawawalan sya ng ganang kumain pero hindi naman nya pwedeng ipahalata iyon sa mga kaibigan. Magtatanong na naman ang mga ito. What will she say to them if they ask?

"Yo!" Halos mapapitlag si Dama sa gulat ng biglang naupo si Zelo sa tabi nya. Ramdam na ramdam nyang parang nagbuhol bigla ang mga bituka nya.

Something felt stuck in her throat at hindi sya agad nakapagsalita.

 

And then her heart... It seemed so ready to jump out of her chest. Napahawak sya sa dibdib. It was like this last night.

 

Be still you stupid organ!





"Oy Zelo! Naks... anlapad ng ngiti ah! Ano'ng meron?"

"Oo nga!" Puna ni Eula. "Parang kahapon ka pa masaya ah? Anyare?"

Dama glanced at Zelo and saw him grinning from ear to ear.

 

That smile...

 


Lalong kumabog ang dibdib nya. Fearing that her heart might explode, iniharang nya ang isa pang kamay nito. She tried clenching it para hindi ito sumabog.

"Dama okay ka lang?" Eli asked. Napansin kase nitong nakahawak sya sa dibdib.

"Y-Yeah." She replied saka nya ibinaba ang mga kamay sa tigkabilang gilid nya. Wrong move. Zelo's left hand was there at napatungan iyon ng kamay nya. She jerked as their hands touched.

"Problema mo?" Napipikang tanong ni Zelo.

"W-Wala." She looked at the food instead. Sinikap nyang kumain without having to touch his arm or his hand.

 

"So Zelo... bakit ka nga ba masaya?" Tanong ni Keeme sa binata.

 

Napatigil si Dama sa pagnguya as she patiently waited for his answer.

 

Dahil kaya sa 'kin?

 

"Sinagot nya na kase ako."

Bakas sa boses nito ang sobrang tuwa. Yung parang kahit hindi mo man makita yung mukha nya, alam mong masaya sya because his aura exuded so much happiness.

"Yun oh!"

"Finally!"

"I'm so happy for you!"

"Manang! Pabili pa ngang giniling!"

 

Nagtawanan silang magbabarkada. Bumili ng extrang giniling si Keeme. Libre daw nya. Once in a blue moon lang mangyari yun kaya tuwang-tuwa sila.

Minsan lang din magka-girlfriend si Zelo.

In fact--first girlfriend nya si Tassie. Kaya naman tuwang-tuwa ang mga kabarkada para sa kanya... finally--after months of pursuing the girl--sinagot na din sya nito.

"Guys hindi rin ako magtatagal. Sasabayan ko kase si Tassie na mag-lunch eh." Paalam ni Zelo sa mga kabarkada.

"Ayeeee... first lunch date nila together as a couple!" Eula squealed.

Ngiti lang ang iginanti ni Zelo. 

 

Naiwan silang lima doon sa kubo na pinagsasaluhan yung ulam na binili ni Keeme. Dama was unusually quiet pero mukhang walang nakakahalata.

Pero sa mga kaibigan, kay Eli sya inis na inis. Punyemas kase--nagdilang anghel yata ang mokong na yun! 

"Hoy Daniella Nasino... space out kung space out?!" Mataray na tanong ni Lei kay Dama.

Wala sa sariling tiningnan nya ito.

 

Nasino.

 

Funny. She totally forgot na yun ang apelyido nya for now. Parang... nag-iba kase yung pagkakaintindi nya sa pagkakapareho nila ng apelyido ni Zelo.

Pinsan ka lang Dama. Pinsan ka lang... she reminded herself. Crush lang naman 'to... mawawala din 'to agad. Pangungumbinsi nya sa sarili.

"DAMA ANO BA?! NAKAKAIRITA NA YANG PAGKALUTANG MO HA!"

 

Dama sighed.

Oo tama... crush lang 'to. And besides, it's not as if my heart is capable of loving anyone but myself. Masasaktan lang ako kapag nagmahal ako kaya--'wag na lang.

"ARAY! NYETA NAMAN OH--" Napahawak siya sa ulo niya ng maramdamang may sumapok sa kanya.

"Ano gising ka na?" Naiiritang tanong ni Lei.

"Bakit ka ba nananapok ha?"

"Kanina ka pa kase namin tinatanong kung ano'ng gusto mong flavor ng ice cream pero tengga ka dyan." Sagot ni Eula.

Dama looked at the ice cream stall na nasa tabi ng school. She made a disgusted face.

"I don't eat dirty ice cream. I only eat gellato."

 

"Gellato? Eh di ba sa Pinocchio yun?" Tanong ni Eli.

Nasapak tuloy sya ni Keeme. "Tanga! Gioseppi yun!" Pagtatama nito sa kaibigan.

Napanguso si Eli. "Aray ko naman!" Reklamo nito.

 

"Isa ka pang tanga eh. Geppeto kaya yun." Sabi ni Dama kay Keeme.

"Pare-parehas din namang G yun." Sagot ni Keeme.

"Oy ano na? Naiinip na si kuya sa inyo." Iritadong untag ni Lei sa mga kaibigan. Iniabot ni kuyang sorbetero yung ice cream nito.

"Is that even safe enough to eat? DIRTY ice cream yan di ba?"

"Wala namang malinis na pagkain eh." Sagot ni Keeme. Saka ito lumapit sa sorbetero at bumili ng ice cream. Sumunod na rin sina Eli at Eula.

Si Dama--bilang nag-iisang hindi kumakain ng ice cream ay nakaramdam ng konting inggit. Mukha kaseng masarap yung ice cream na kinakain ng mga kaibigan nya.

May mga chunks pa ng chocolates and strawberries tapos magkakapatong yung iba't ibang flavors. 

"Sige na nga. I'll try one." 

 

Nginitian sya ng mga kaibigan. "Try mo lahat ng flavor!" Aya ni Eula.

"Masarap yan kapag nasa tinapay." Lei suggested.

"Eh di go." Sabi na lang nya. She ordered based on their suggestions. 

 

Si Zelo kaya, gusto ng ice cream?

 

Mariing napailing si Dama sa tinatakbo ng isip. Hindi. Wala lang 'to. Crush lang 'to...  She took a bite of the ice cream on a bun. Somehow, nagulo ng bahagya yung daloy ng thought nya when the cold dessert hit her tongue.

Masarap nga pala...

"Uy sina Zelo o!"

Agad syang napalingon sa tinuro ni Keeme. Sa di kalayuan, nakita nilang naglalakad sina Zelo at Tassie papasok ng school--magkahawak ang mga kamay at parehong nakangiti.

Dama's stupid little organ sank to the depths of her depressing sea.

 

She can't seem to bear the fact that he's smiling because of that girl.

I told you... you can't like anybody. Pero pasaway ka talaga. Ayan--magdusa ka. She said to her heart.

"Grabe... buti pa si Zelo may girlfriend na." Naiinggit na sabi ni Keeme.

"Wag kang mainggit. Di naman bagay sa 'yo ang may girlfriend eh." 

Napanguso si Keeme sa sinabi ni Eli. "Tss. Magkaka-girlfriend din ako kala mo."

Tumawa si Lei. "Sino namang papatol sa 'yo?"

"Luh! Nagsalita ang hindi maka-move on sa ex nya--NERD." Pang-aasar naman ni Keeme kay Lei. Napikon agad si Lei at tinapik ang kamay ni Keeme--natapon tuloy yung ice cream nya.

Humarang na sa gitna nila si Eli bago pa man makapagsakalan ang dalawa.

"Ano ba! Mag-aaway na naman kayo!"

"Eh sya kase!" Nagturuan ang dalawa.

"Alam nyo kapag kayo nagkatuluyan nako--" Naiiling na sabi ni Eli. Pinangilabutan ang dalawa sa narinig at sabay na kumatok. Si Lei--sa lalagyanan nung ice cream. Si Keeme, sa ulo ni Eli.

"Tara na nga sa classroom." Walang ganang sabi ni Dama.

"Classroom na agad? 1:30 pa ang start ng next class ah?"

Napabuntong-hininga na lang si Dama. "Sige una na 'ko."

"'WAG! Bata ka pa!" pabirong sabi ni Eli. Hindi naman iyon pinansin ng dalaga at nagpatuloy lang ito sa paglalakad pabalik sa school.

"Ano'ng nangyari dun?" Tanong ni Eli sa mga kasama.

"Baka nakornihan sa joke mo." Sagot naman ni Lei.

 

--

 

Kinagabihan... 

Nagulat si Zelo ng pagkatapos kumain ay nagligpit ng pinagkainan si Dama. Nagkusa na ito--himala naman yata! Kanina pa rin ito nananahimik at walang kibo. Ni hindi ito nagreklamo sa ulam nilang daing.

Nagkatinginan na lamang ang mag-ina.

"Anak ako na ang magliligpit nyan." Sabi ni Manang Pacing sa dalaga. Hindi sya pinansin nito at patuloy pa rin sa paghuhugas ng pinggan.

"Hayaan mo na 'nay." Nakangiting sabi ni Zelo sa ina. Natutuwa sya kahit papano sa ginagawa ni Dama. Syempre nga naman... menos na yun sa gawain ng nanay nya.

 

Pero nawiwirduhan talaga sya sa inaasal ng pinsan nya.

Ganito na lang ba tayo lagi, little organ? Palihim na titingin sa kanya?

 

Napabuntong-hininga si Dama habang nagnanakaw na naman ng tingin kay Zelo. Ito na siguro yung sinasabi nilang so close yet so far. Yung magkatabi lang sila sa upuan pero parang hindi ito ma-reach. Katabi rin nito sa kabilang side ang girlfriend nito na sobrang little miss perfect.

Perfect face.

Perfect laugh.

Perfect attitude.

 

Ang layo-layo nya kay Dama. Kaya siguro hindi na sya magugustuhan ng pinsan nya. Come to think of it... Magpinsan sila--although that's not entirely true... pero kung magkakagusto sya kay Zelo, mali iyon sa paningin ng ibang tao.

Lalo na nina Eli. Ano na lang ang sasabihin nila kapag nalaman nilang may HD sya sa pinsan nya?

 

Kaya ikaw, 'wag kang maingay. Stop beating so loud.. baka marinig ka nila, bulong nya sa puso nya. Naeengotan na nga sya sa ginagawa nya eh. Halos maya't maya nya kausap ang sarili. Wala naman syang mapagsabihang iba.

 

--

 

Palagi nilang kasama si Tassie. Kapag kakain sila ng fishball sa labas, kasama si Tassie. Gusto ngang masuka ni Dama everytime na nagsusubuan ng fishball yung dalawa eh.

"Ayos ah! Ilang fishball ang kasya sa bibig mo?" Puna sa kanya ni Eli.

Subo kase sya ng subo ng fishball ng hindi ngumunguya. Ang ending, napuno yung bibig nya. Hindi naman nya masagot si Eli dahil tatalbog ang kinakain nya.

She glanced at Zelo and Tassie. She rolled her eyes exasperatedly ng makitang parang hindi man lang lumalapat sa labi ni Tassie yung fishball. Parang ayaw madumihan ang mukha.

Sa inis ni Dama sa sarili dahil ang baboy nyang kumain, hinila nya si Lei sa katabing stall ng scramble.

"Uy Dama ang takaw mo ah!"

Pinanlisikan nya na lamang ito ng mata. Ngumunguya pa kase sya ng fishball kaya panay turo na lang at ungot ang naisasagot nya.

 

Hindi lang sa ganun palaging kakabit si Tassie. Pati na rin sa inuman ng barkada, kabuntot pa ito. Sobrang KJ pa kase ayaw paglasingin si Zelo. Di naman sya umiinom.

 

Naiimbyerna lang si Dama kaya mas minabuti pa nyang umiwas sa kanila. Palagi syang nagbabaon ng pagkain tuwing lunch at dun sa classroom sya kumakain. Hindi rin sya nasabay kay Zelo--sabagay ay hindi na naman talaga sila nagsasabay pagpasok.

Hindi rin sila sabay umuwi dahil inihahatid pa nito si Tassie.

Sa bahay naman, hindi na sya sumasabay sa mag-iina pagkain dahil malamang sa hindi ay makakasabay nya si Zelo. Kaya pag-nauuna syang dumating sa bahay, kumakain na sya kaagad at nagkukulong sa kwarto pagkatapos.

Nawiwirduhan na nga sa kanya ang mga kasama nya sa bahay pero wala syang pakialam. Basta sya.. may heart-to-heart sessions gabi-gabi with herself.

 

Ilang araw na rin syang ganoon and somehow, her feelings managed to wane down a bit. Hindi nya na kase madalas makita si Zelo. Tama nga yung sabi nila... out of sight, out of mind.




Konti na lang little organ, nakangiti nyang tinapik-tapik ang dibdib.

 

--

 

Maaga syang isang araw na kase ang saya-saya nya. Sabi na nga ba parang gutom lang yan eh... lumilipas. Kinuha nya ang towel at dere-deretsong nagpunta sa banyo.




Sana hanggang mamaya ko sya hindi makita no? Para hindi ka nag-iingay--

 

"AHHHH!!!"

 

Pagkahakbang ni Dama sa loob ng CR, nakita nya si Zelo na nakatalikod. Naka-shorts naman ito pero hubad tapos may naka-drape na towel sa kanang balikat. Maliligo na rin ata ito.

Sa sobrang pagsasarili ni Dama, hindi man lang nya namalayan na may tao na sa banyo. Ayun, sa kabiglaan, na-off balance sya at napaurong. One step higher yung CR kaya na-miss nya yung isang step na yun na sobrang ikinakaba sya.

And then the worst thing happened--she twisted her ankle.

 

She howled in pain.

 

Agad naman syang inalalayan ni Zelo papunta sa sala.

"Ano'ng nangyari?" Nagpapanic na tanong ni Manang Pacing na may dala-dala pang walis-tingting sa pagpasok.

"Yaya, I'm dying!" Naiiyak na sagot ni Dama.

"OA nito. Tss. Parang napilayan lang eh..." 

"Masakit kaya! Try mong mapilayan!" Naiinis niyang sagot sa pinsan.

"Eh kung di ka ba naman patanga-tanga? Alam ng may tao sa banyo tapos dere-deretso ka pa? Ano'ng gusto mo--sabay tayong maliligo?"

 Agad na namula ang pisngi ni Dama sa sinabi ni Zelo.

"Eh malay ko bang nandun ka! Di mo naman sinasarado yung pinto!"

 

"Ay ano ba? Nag-aaway na naman kayo!"

 

"Ewan ko ba dyan nay. Natuluyan na ata." Naiiling na sagot ni Zelo sa ina. Tinanggal nito ang towel sa kanang balikat at ini-drape sa ulo nito. Saka ito bumalik sa CR.

Naiwan si Dama doon na umiiyak sa sakit ng paa nya.

 

Ayan little organ--may karamay ka na, bulong nya sa sarili.

 

Agad kumuha si Manang Pacing ng towel saka nagpabili kay Meera ng yelo mula sa kapitbahay. Ginamot ng mag-ina ang namamagang bukong-bukong ni Dama.

"Papasok ka ba anak?" Tanong sa kanya ng matanda.

"Heck no!" Mangiyak-ngiyak but nevertheless ay mataray nyang sagot.

Napabuntong-hininga si Manang. "Sya sige. Mabuti pa nga siguro kung maglalagi ka muna sa bahay. Ikaw muna ang tumao dine ha? Mamamalengke lang ako."

"What? You'll leave me here alone? Pano kapag nagutom ako?"

"Malapit lang naman ang kusina anak."

"Kahit na! Masakit ang paa ko!" Reklamo niya sa kawawang matanda.

 

"Kung ayaw mong magkusa eh di pakamatay ka sa gutom." Sabat naman ni Zelo na kakatapos lang maligo.

"Zelo!" Saway ng matanda sa anak.

Napasimangot na lang si Dama. Ano ba namang laban nya dito? Eh gusto nya ang binata. Wala syang magagawa. Manahimik na lang kesa kung ano pang masabi.

At baka mahuli.

 

That would be awkward.

 

Nanahimik na lamang si Dama while nursing her ankle habang pinapanuod ang pinsan na magpaalik-balik sa CR at kwarto. Nakabihis na ito. Nagpabango. Nagpagwapo ng husto...

At alam naman nya kung bakit at para kanino--kaya lalo syang naaasar.

Ayaw na ayaw nya talagang may kaagaw sa kahit anong bagay. Lalo na sa lalaki. Kapag gusto nya, gusto nya kanya lang.

Kaya ang hirap nitong napasukan nya... yung gusto nya, iba ang gusto.

At alam nyang malayo pa sa buwan ang pag-asa nya sa lalaki.

 

--

 

Nakatulog si Dama sa sala at hindi nya namalayan na nakabalik na pala si Manang Pacing mula sa palengke. Bumangon lang ang dalaga ng mapansing busy sa pagluluto ang matanda. She craned her neck to see what's being cooked.

Napataas ang kilay nya ng mapansing maraming rekado sa lamesa.

"Ano'ng meron ya? Ang dami mo naman yatang niluluto?"

Ngumiti ang matanda sa kanya. "Dito kase manananghalian ang girlfriend ni Zelo. Ipapakilala daw nya sa 'kin."

 


Her heart sank yet again.

Ano ba yan little organ. Pati ba naman si yaya aagawin pa sa 'kin?

Halatang excited ang matanda na ma-meet si Tassie. For sure naman, ibinibida na ni Zelo ang girlfriend nito sa matanda. Dama thinks that he can't even say anything bad about that girl.

Little miss perfect nga eh... di nya katulad. Presensya pa lang nya, nakakairita na.

 

Nagpumilit tumayo ang dalaga. Napatigil tuloy si Manang Pacing sa paghihimay ng malunggay at patakbo itong lumapit sa kanya.

"Anak san ka pupunta?"

"Kwarto." She replied curtly.

"Matutulog ka na naman?"

"Hindi. Kakain ako sa kwarto. Mamaya ako matutulog sa kusina." Pabalbal nyang sagot. 

Hindi nag-react ang matanda. Inalalayan lang sya nito hanggang sa makaupo sya ng maayos sa papag.

"Hindi ka sasabay pagkain mamaya?" Tanong nito sa kanya.

"Hindi na. Mas gusto kong kumaing mag-isa."

Naupo ang matanda sa tabi nya.

"Nakilala mo na ba yung girlfriend ni Zelo anak?"

 

"Oo." Sagot nya. Di nya matarayan ang matanda kapag may anak sa sentence nito.

Aaaah... ewan ko sa'yo little organ. Feelingera ka masyado. Naiinis nyang sabi sa sarili.

"Kamusta naman sya?" Nakangiting tanong ng matanda.

"Ayos lang. Mapagtityagaan naman."

"Ano'ng itsura?"

 

"Mas maganda ako." Sagot nya.

 

Tumawa ang matanda. Hindi na ito nanibago sa sagot ng dalaga dahil lagi namang ganito ang sagot nito sa mga ganoong tanong.

MAS lamang sya palagi.

 

"Sana mabait din sya."

Dama rolled her eyes at saka sya pabagsak na nahiga sa kama.

 

Wish granted old lady....

 

"Sana magtagal sila ng anak ko." Ngumiti ang matanda sa sarili at lumabas ng kwarto. Napahinga ng malalim si Dama at tumingin sa skeleton ng bubong.

 

 

 

 

Sana hindi.

AN: Guys! Alam nyo ba? Naiiyak ako kanina habang naiimagine ko yung ending nito. Haha.. OO. May ending na sya kahit hindi ko alam ang shortcuts at tamang daan papunta dun. Sana magawa ko syang as nakakaiyak as I imagined the ending to be.

Sa mga naghahanap kay Pierre... sa bandang huli pa sya talaga. Bata pa si Dama. For all we know, baka kapag 20 something na sya na sila magkikita ni Pierre.

For now... enjoy the DaLo, ZeMa or whatever consolidated names you came up with ^^

[14] Chapter 13
*******************************************
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.

--


Tanggap na si Tassie ng ina at kapatid ni Zelo. Tanggap na rin ito ng barkada. Si Dama na lang talaga ang resistant sa dalaga. How can she like the girl who stole her first crush?

Mabuti pa ang alak... kahit temporary comfort lang ang naibibigay... kahit sandali naman, nakakalimutan nya ang sakit.

Kaya heto sya... nag-iinom. Kakatapos lang ng prelim exams nila kaya naman nagkayayaan ang magbabarkada na mag-inuman. Overnight swimming plus inuman to be exact. Eto pa ang masaklap--sagot ni Tassie ang pulutan kaya naman halos sambahin na sya nina Eli at Keeme.

Lalong nayamot si Dama.

 

Kung sana ay mayaman pa sya ngayon, eh di sana hindi lang pulutan ang naiambag nya. Siguro ay nabili na rin sana niya ang resort para kahit kelan ay pwede silang magpabalik-balik na magbabarkada doon.

Pero wala nga syang pera kaya hanggang isang bote lang ng San Mig Light ang naiambag niya.

 

"Uy Zelo tagay mo na!" Si Lei ang tanggera. Iniabot nito ang shot glass kay Zelo. Inagaw naman iyon ni Dama at sya ang uminom.

"Aish. Dama wait for your turn! Nagugulo eh!" Naiinis na sabi ni Eula sa kanya.

"Hindi rin naman sya papainumin kaya ako na ang uminom nung iinumin nyang inumin." She blurted out. Kanina pa sya nahihilo at parang gusto nya ng mag-dive sa pool na katabi lang ng pwesto nila.

Halos lahat kase ng tagay ay inagaw na niya.

 

Little organ, may kiddie pool ka na ba dyan? Pakalunod ka muna ha?

 

Lei filled up the shot glass with liquor saka iyon iniabot kay Tassie.

"Tass ikaw na."

Ngumiti ng pilit si Tassie saka kinuha ang baso na iniaabot ni Lei. Hindi kase ito umiinom. Pinipilit lang sya ni Lei.

Nakita ni Dama na parang sinenyasan sya ni Tassie na agawin dito yung baso. Inirapan lang ito ni Dama.

 

Drink it bitch. It's not mine.

 

Tassie looked helplessly at Zelo, who in turn, took the shot glass from his girlfriend's hand and consumed the content in one gulp.

"Ay ano ba yan! Ang daya!" Reklamo ni Lei.

"Allergic sya sa alak kaya di sya pwedeng uminom." Pagdedefend ni Zelo sa girlfriend.

"Tss. Allergic o nag-iinarte?" Bulong ni Dama sa sarili. Tumayo siya at nagpunta sa tabi ng slide na malapit sa pool nila. Naupo sya sa gilid ng pool then dipped her feet in the water.

 

Little heart... look at them. Ang saya-saya nila no? Bakit tayo hindi sumaya ng ganyan?

 

She remembered Krauss. Ngayon lang nya narealize na parang sobrang desperada nya nga pala nung time na yun. She wanted him... not because she likes him or anything close to that. She wanted him because he posed as a challenge.

At saka feel nya lang mang-agaw dahil naiirita sya sa girlfriend nito.

 

Now looking at Zelo and Tassie... narealize nya na mas gusto nya ng ganun. Yung kusa kang ginugusto ng isang tao.

Ang sakit lang kase nung ikaw pa ang humihingi ng atensiyon.

 

Kailan ba sya huling nagkaroon ng kaibigan katulad ng mga kaibigan nya ngayon? She can't even remember having one. She grew up talking and playing with her dolls and maids. Saktan man nya ang mga ito, walang magrereklamo.

They don't fight back.

They don't talk back.

But they don't care back either.

She can't remember how many times she's been wishing to have a live and talking bear. Yung bear na pwedeng kausapin. Yung sasagot kapag tinanong. Yung yayakapin ka pabalik.

Pero wala namang ganun di ba?

 

Kailangan mo ng tao. Yung magki-care back. Yung sisigawan ka kapag nagpapakatanga ka sa isang lalaki. 

Yung ibibigay ang kalahati ng baon nya kapag wala kang pagkain.

Yung susugudin yung mga umaaway sa 'yo.

 

Sila yun eh.

 

At kapag natapos na lahat ng 'to at bumalik na sya sa dati nyang buhay... she knew they won't be around.

 

Mamimiss nya yung katangahan ni Eli at yung mga payakap-yakap nito sa kanila.. Na kahit saan mo sya yakagin, sasamahan ka nya.

Yung pagsigaw-sigaw ni Lei na tanging paraan lang nito para maipakita ang care nya sa 'yo. Hindi kase ito yung taong sweet na uulanin ka ng compliment. Sya yung kaibigan na mahilig mag-degrade at manglait pero kapag may ibang umaway sa 'yo--sya mismo ang nasa front line ng gera.

Yung pagka-alaskador ni Keeme. Lahat na lang ng ginagawa mo may nasasabi syang hindi maganda. Pero kapag nalulungkot ka, hindi ka nya tatantanan hanggat hindi ka nito napapangiti.

Yung mga beauty tips ni Eula saka yung mga pagpapahiram nito ng damit at accessories. Saka malambing ito at sweet. Mahilig itong yumakap at makipag-beso-beso.

 

At syempre pa... si Zelo.

 

Di naman nya akalaing magkakagusto sya sa taong yun. Sa kabila ng kayabangan nito at pagiging kontra sa lahat ng gusto nya, he managed to find a way around her and strike thru her heart.

Na kasalukuyang kumikirot.

 

Okay lang yan little organ... marami pang lalaki dyan. Di lang sya.

 

"Uy... nag-eemo ka ata?" Naupo si Keeme sa tabi nya. May dala-dala itong bote ng beer.

"Ano ngayon sa 'yo?" Mataray nyang tanong dito.

Napipikang ngumuso sa kanya si Keeme. "Eh kung inihuhulog kaya kita? Sungit mo ah!"

"Sino ba naman kaseng may sabing tabihan mo 'ko ha?"

Tumayo si Keeme. "Pinapatawag ka lang nila no. Feeling mo gusto kitang tabihan? Tss." Pagkasabi'y naglakad ito pabalik sa mga kabarkada.

Dama saw Eula wave at her. Pinapabalik na sya sa pwesto nya.

 

She sighed and then head back to them. Truth or dare pa pala ang maaabutan nya.

"Truth or dare?" Tanong ni Zelo kay Lei.

"Truth!" Lei answered.

"In love ka pa sa ex mo no?" Maintrigang tanong ni Zelo. 

"Dare na lang pala!"

"Wala! Sagutin mo!"

 

Lei grunted. "Di ko alam!"

"Yes or no lang eh!"

"Di ko nga alam okay? Seryoso. Di ko talaga alam." Naiinis na sagot ng dalaga.

Di naman talaga nito alam eh. Kapag nakikita nya si Jeric, parang meron pa. Pero kapag wala naman ito, bigla ring nawawala.

Kaya hindi nya talaga alam.

 

Nalilito sya.

 

Si Zelo ang sunod na tinanong.

"Zelo... truth or dare?"

"Dare." He answered.

 

Nakita ni Dama na ngumisi si Keeme.

"Kiss mo nga si Tassie! Yeeeee!"

Nagsisapawan naman ang iba pa niyang mga kabarkada.

"Oo nga! Dali!"

"Lips to lips ha!"

 

Parehong namula ang magkasintahan. Si Dama naman ay hindi na nakapagsalita sa sobrang pagkataranta. Natataranta ang isip niya.

Please 'wag...

 

"Iba na lang kase." Nahihiyang sabi ni Zelo.

"Eeeeh! Dali na! Smack lang naman eh!"

"Payag naman si Tass o!" Puna ni Eli ng napansing hindi nagrereklamo ang dalaga.

 

Tiningnan ni Zelo si Tassie.

"Ayeeeee! Ayan na!" Kinikilig na sabi ni Eula.

 

Pumikit si Dama. Ayaw nyang makitang manakaw ang first kiss ng first crush nya. 

Masakit.

 

Limang minuto ang nakalipas...

"Uy dali na aba!"

Nagmulat ng mata si Dama. Mukhang hindi naman pala matutuloy. Masyado syang kinakabahan.

 

"Next time na lang!" Pagtanggi ni Zelo.

 

"Ngayon na! Wala namang malisya eh! Saka magjowa naman kayo eh!"

 

Napabuntong-hininga ang binata. It looks like they won't let him get away without kissing his girlfriend. Nahihiya naman sya kay Tassie sa mga ipinagagawa ng mga kabarkada nya.

It's a good thing that she's not getting offended or repulsed yet.

 

Dama watched--as if in slow motion--as Tassie gently held Zelo's face and angled it towards her. Saka nya marahang hinila pababa ang mukha ng binata.

 

Eula, Keeme, Eli and Lei were all shocked at first. Syempre di naman nila akalaing yung babae pa ang mag-iinitiate.

Nang makabawi, nagsimula na silang manukso.

 

Wala na. Nakuha na nya pati yung first kiss namin. Sobrang lugong-lugo si Dama sa nakita. Alam mo yung feeling little organ? Wala ka kaseng mata eh. Swerte mo di mo nakita.





Gusto nyang umiyak. Isa na namang gusto nya ang hindi nya nakuha.

 

Bakit ba kase ang damot-damot ng mundo sa kanya?

 

 

 

Pagod na 'ko little organ. Can you just stop beating already and end my misery?


xxxxx

AN: Sorry kung sabaw. Haha... naisipan ko lang mag-UD kahit 10 PM na ako nakapagsimula. Marami pa kase yan eh. I want her to be miserable pa.

Kinukulang talaga ako. Di ko na sya feel masyado. =_= Gusto ko kaseng sa ending na. Clear na clear na yun sa 'kin eh pati yung mga linya nila.

Kaso mukhang matagal pa yun. Mga 10 chapters! Hahaha...

COMMENTS!

[15] Chapter 14
*******************************************
I'll wait patiently until you're brave enough to fall for me.

--


Araw ng Linggo.

Maagang umalis ng bahay si Manang Pacing at Meera para mamalengke. Naiwan ang magpinsan sa bahay na tulog pa rin kahit alas syete na ng umaga.

Nagising si Dama ng mga bandang alas nwebe ng umaga dahil sa gutom. Agad lumabas ng kwarto para maghagilap ng pagkain sa kusina. When she opened the door, agad niyang namataan ang pinsan na natutulog sa sofa ng mahirap as she likes to call it.

Ito yung upuan na yari sa bamboo tapos may mga throw pillow na pinagtagpi-tagping retaso yun punda.

Naka-stretch dun si Zelo at nakapatong yung braso sa mga mata nito. Tulog na tulog pa rin.

 

Nilapitan sya ni Dama.

 

Dama settled on top of the bamboo table, which she likes to refer to as coffee table ng mahirap. Mahilig syang maupo dun kahit ilang beses na syang napagalitan ng mga kasama sa bahay.

She's always perched on top of that, naka-indian sit.

 

Pinagmasdan niya ang pinsan. Pawis-pawisan na ito dahil tanghali na at wala pa silang electric fan. She had the urge to get a fan at kusang paypayan ito pero pinigilan nya ang sarili.

Baka kase magising ito at magtaka. Baka maungkat pa yung sikreto nya.

 

Little organ, sumasayaw ka na naman dyan. Tinitingnan ko pa lang sya ah?

 

Napahawak si Dama sa dibdib.

 

Malala na 'to. This can't be.... I need to find a distraction.

 

She was already getting lost in her thoughts ng magising ang lalaki. And by simply meeting his stare, her heart instantly became erratic.

"G-Good morning." Nababalisa nyang bati dito.

He just looked at her sleepily. Malamang ay antok na antok pa rin ito. His eyes are still half-closed. Magulo ang buhok nito na kung saan-saang dereksiyon nakaturo.

Still... she's never met a guy as attractive as he is,even with his current state.

 

Nagpalinga-linga si Zelo.

"Ang nanay?"

"Namamalengke."

"Si Meera?"

"Kasama."

 

Zelo craned his neck to look at the kitchen table. "Nagsaing ka?"

"Kakagising ko lang." Sagot ni Dama.

Tiningnan sya ng binata. Bigla tuloy syang na-conscious. Di pa kase sya nagsusuklay. Ni hindi pa nagmumumog at naghihilamos.

He tsk-ed. "Bakit nakaupo ka na naman sa lamesa?!" Pasigaw nitong tanong.

Sa kabiglaan, napatayo kaagad ang dalaga.

"Sorry naman."

 

Naglakad papuntang kusina ang binata. Sinundan nya ito.

"Magdikit ka ng apoy."

She looked confused. "Pano didikit ang apoy?"

He glared at her. "Namimilosopo ka? Magsindi ka ng kalan!"

"Kalan? Asan?" Sa pagkakaalam ni Dama, ni wala ngang Solane ang pamilya nina Manang Pacing.

Itinuro ni Zelo ang kalang de uling na matagal ng hindi pinapansin ni Dama. 

"Nakakapagluto kayo dyan?" Taka nyang tanong.

Zelo rolled his eyes heavenwards. "Araw-araw kang kumakain dito tapos hindi mo alam?"

 

Tiningnan muli ng dalaga ang kalang de uling.

"Pano ko sisindihan yan?"

"Dasalan mo... baka sakaling umapoy." Sagot ng lalaki bago ito pumasok sa CR. Naiwan si Dama na nababano pa rin sa kalang de uling.

 

Kung yung rice cooker nga namin sa bahay na de saksak lang, di ko pa nagagamit... ito pa kaya? San ako gagawa ng apoy dito? Tss.

 

Nakalabas na si Zelo ng CR, nandun pa rin si Dama sa tapat ng kalan--trying to figure out how it works.

"Ano wala pa rin?" Iritadong tanong ng lalaki sa kanya.

"I don't know how to start a fire with this thing!"

Napabuntong-hininga na lamang ang lalaki at naiiling na kumuha ng uling mula sa katabing sako.

"Tabi nga. Tuturuan kita."

 

Tumayo si Dama para mag-give way sa lalaki.

"Maglagay ka muna ng uling sa ibabaw nito." Zelo poured a handful of coal to the stove. "Kunin mo yung kutsara."

"Where?" Tanong ng dalaga.

"Sa ilalim nyan. Dali na!"

Hinanap ni Dama ang kutsarang sinasabi ng pinsan. Nakita nya iyon sa bandang ilalim ng kalan. She took it out and upon seeing that it waas full of ash--itinaktak nya iyon sa sahig.

"Tanga! Bat mo ibinubo?"

"Bakit? Hindi ba dapat?"

"Dyan ka nga magsisindi eh!" Napahilamos ng mukha si Zelo gamit ang isa nyang kamay. "Akin na nga!" Hinablot nya kay Dama ang kutsara.

Napapitlag naman ang dalaga sa pagkabigla ng biglang magkadikit ng konting-konting kagahiblang wala pa yatang dalawang segundo ang kanilang mga kamay.

 

Whoa. Easy there little organ.

 

Pinuno ni Zelo ang kutsara ng abo mula sa kalan. Pagkatapos ay kinuha nya ang bote ng gas at binudburan iyon ng kaunti.

Ng mabasa ang abo, kinuha nya ang lighter at sinindihan iyon. Tapos ay ibinalik nya ang kutsara sa loob ng kalan.

"Paypayan mo." Utos nito sa kanya sabay salo ng pamaypay.

 

Dama did as she was told.

 

Si Zelo naman, seeing na wala pang sinaing, ay kinuha ang kaldero at nilagyan iyon ng tatlong takal ng bigas.

"Halika dito." Tawag nya sa pinsan na nakita niyang sarili ang pinapaypayan at hindi ang kalan.

Tumayo si Dama at lumapit sa lababo.

"Di ka marunong magsaing no?" Tanong ng lalaki sa kanya.

She shook her head.

 

"Prinsesang prinsesa ka eh." Nasusuyang puna ng lalaki. "Magtatakal ka lang ng bigas dun sa takalan natin. Tatlong takal para hanggang mamaya. Nagsimba pa yata ang mga nanay kaya mamaya pa sila uuwi."

"Okay. Tapos?"

"Tapos susukatin mo yung tubig. Dapat proportionate sa dami ng bigas." Sagot ng lalaki.

"Pano mo ime-measure?"

 

Nabitawan ni Dama ang pamaypay na hawak ng kunin ni Zelo ang kamay nya at itinubog iyon sa kaldero na may lamang bigas at tubig. Pinipigilan niya ang mag-blush pero kinikilig talaga sya dahil hawak ni Zelo ang kamay nya.

"Damahin mo yung bigas tapos tandaan mo kung sang parte ng kamay mo umabot."

He made an imaginary line on her palm.

"Tapos sukatin mo naman yung tubig. Dapat yung dulo ng daliri mo ay nakapatong sa bigas. Kapag pareho sila ng taas, okay na yun."

 

Nagegets mo ba little organ? Ay... I forgot--di ka nga pala nag-iisip.

 

"Naintindihan mo ba?" Tanong ng lalaki sa kanya.

She nodded.

Binitawan ni Zelo ang kamay nya.

"Sige nga. Ano nga ulit?"

 

"Measure the rice and then the water. Kung san umabot yung rice, dapat ganun din karami yung tubig. Tama?"

Ngumiti si Zelo sa kanya saka ginulo ang buhok niya gamit ang basa nitong kamay.

"Good. Hugasan mo yan ng tatlong beses. Siguraduhin mong walang matatapong bigas ah?"

"Okay."

 

Si Dama ang naghugas ng bigas at ingat na ingat sya sa pagme-measure dahil baka maparami ang tubig sya. Ingat na ingat din sya sa paghuhugas dahil baka matapon ang bigas.

Magagalit si Zelo... ayaw na ayaw pa naman nyang nagagalit ito sa kanya.

 

Ng may ningas na ang uling, isinaklang na nila ang bigas sa kalan.

 

"Bantayan mo yang sinaing ha? Maliligo muna ako."

"Eeee... ano'ng gagawin ko pagkatapos?"

"Antayin mong kumulo." Sagot ni  Zelo.

"Tapos?"

"Tapos tanggalin mo yung takip."

"Tapos?"

Zelo sighed. "Ako na nga lang!"

 

--

 

Salamat naman at naluto ng maayos ang sinaing. Nagprito sila ng isda pagkatapos. And then they ate.

Nagtaka pa si Dama at mukhang bihis na bihis si Zelo. Naka-long-sleeves ito na checkered tapos dark maong pants. Nagpabango pa.

"San punta?" Tanong nya rito.

"Sisimba."

"Pasama!" Hindi sya mahilig magsimba but she'd like to experience going to church with someone she likes. Her mom has this weird theory na anything new, kapag isinimba mo, magtatagal at titibay. She didn't know if it works on things but she wants to try.

Kapag kaya sabay silang nagsimba ay magtatagal at titibay silang dalawa?

 

"Di pwede. May date ako."

 

Her heart sank yet again.

 

"Ah..." Matamlay nyang sagot.

"Bagay ba?" Nagawa pang itanong nito sa kanya. Nilapitan nya ito then she unbuttoned the cuffs of his sleeves.

"Mas okay kung iro-roll mo sya hanggang sa elbows mo." She rolled both sleeves up to his elbow.

"Hmm... oo nga no?"

Ngumiti ito sa kanya as if thanking her.

"Magulo ba buhok ko?" Tanong nitong muli sa kanya.

"Hindi naman."

"Eh yung pabango ko? Mabango ba?" Lumapit ito sa kanya ng konti.

"Ayos lang." Walang-gana nyang sagot.

 

"Sige. Aalis muna 'ko. Wag kang aalis ng bahay ha? Baka biglang dumating sina nanay."

"Okay."

 

Nakatatlong balik pa ito sa salamin bago nakuntento at tuluyang umalis ng bahay. Napasalampak si Dama sa upuan.

 

Tassie bat ang swerte mo?

 

She sighed.

 

Little organ... you need to kick him out na. You need a new tenant--yung nagbabayad.

 

xxxxxx

AN: Hi! Wala lang... salamat sa mga nag-encourage sa 'kin kahapon. I won't point it out anymore. I just want to thank you guys. Masaya ako kahit papano ngayong araw na 'to so I'll leave you with the update. 700 votes na ang Dama eh. Saka ang sipag nyo mag-comment. Sana ituloy nyo yan. 

Thank you! <3

Arrogant girl, love yourself so no one has to. They're better off without you.

Matamang pinagmamasdan ni Dani ang asawa. Kanina pa ito paikot-ikot sa bedroom nila, walis ng walis ng imaginary na kalat at punas ng punas ng non-existent na alikabok. She kept on arranging and rearranging the things inside the bedroom too.

Kanina pa ito parang balisa at malungkot. Alam naman niya kung bakit but she keeps on denying it whenever he brings it up.

 

Hindi na nya matagalan ang pagiging miserable ng asawa kaya nilapitan niya ito at niyakap ng mahigpit.

"Mommy what's wrong?" Malambing niyang tanong dito.

He heard her sigh. Ibinaba nito sa lamesa ang hawak na feather duster. "Ano ba dad? Bakit ba tanong ka ng tanong ng what's wrong? Nothing's wrong--I'm just cleaning."

"Wala namang kalat eh." He pointed out.

"I'm just bored dad. Don't mind me."

 

Iniikot ni Dani ang asawa paharap sa kanya. He cupped her face with his hands saka nya ito hinalikan sa ilong.

"Malungkot ka na naman." He said after.

"I'm not sad." Tanggi naman ni Megan.

"You can't fool me. You're miserable." Sumimangot si Dani. "I hate seeing you sad ma. It makes me sad too."

Megan forced a smile and hugged him back.

"I'm fine daddy. Don't worry."

"No. You're sad." Pagpupumilit ni Dani.

 

Megan sighed. "I'm fine nga daddy. I'm perfectly happy!" Nakangiti nitong sagot sa kanya.

"If you were happy, you don't have to point it out. I'd feel it."

"Kaya ko nga pinu-point out because you're pointing out that I'm sad eh." She answered, rolling her eyes.

"Well because you are."

"Hindi nga ako malungkot daddy. Ang kulit mo naman."

 

Hinila ni Dani ang asawa paupo sa lap nya when he sat on the edge of the bed.

"What can I do to make you happy?"

"I AM happy." Meg insisted.

"But you aren't. Come on ma, help me here. Pano ba kita mapapasaya?"

Meg touched his face. "Masaya ako dad... kase kasama kita." Banat niya sa asawa.

"I'm not buying that." Nakasimangot na sagot ni Dani.

Meg sighed. "What do you want me to say?"

"The truth." He said directly.

"I am happy." Sabi nya sa asawa. "But I feel empty dad. There's no one to shout at in this house anymore."

Dani's brows creased. "Will shouting at someone make you happy?"

"Yes." She replied curtly.

 

"Then shout at me." He said.

 

"Ayoko sa 'yo. You're docile." She said with a pout. "I want someone who's stupid enough to fight me back."

"Like Dama?"

Meg shrugged. "Well... yeah."

"So are you saying you're missing her?" Panghuhuli niya dito.

"A bit--" Nasagot naman ni Meg. Agad nyang pinanlakihan ng mata ang asawa ng marealize kung ano ang ginawa nito. "Hey--"

He laughed then stole a kiss from her. "Sabi ko na nga ba."

 

"Hinuhuli mo 'ko eh." She said with accusation in her voice.

"I told you... you can't lie to me." He replied with confidence.

May ilang segundo ring nagkatitigan ang mag-asawa.

 

"What?" Takang-tanong ni Dani ng hindi na nagsalita si Meg. Nakatingin na lang ito sa kanya--animo'y nag-iisip ng malalim.

"Nothing. I'm just trying to imagine my life if I hadn't married you." She answered.

"And?"

 

 

 

 

"I can't."

 

--

 

Naabutan ni Dama si Eula na nag-aayos sa ilalim ng puno ng mangga. So far naman, may mga bagay pa rin sa buhay nila na hindi pa rin nagbabago.

Feelings nya lang yata ang nagbago eh.

"Hoy." Bati niya rito.

"Hoy back." Umusod si Eula para makaupo si Dama sa tabi nya.

"Pansin ko lang, bakit ka dito nag-aayos? May CR naman." Tanong nya rito.

Bahagyang namula ang dalaga sa tanong niya.

 

"Masama bang dito mag-ayos?"

Dama squinted her eyes at Eula. "Sabihin mo nga... kanino ka nagpapa-cute?"

"Wala!"

Nagpalinga-linga si Dama. The only people she can see na malapit sa kanila ay ang men's volleyball team ng school nila. Araw-araw ang mga ito sa pagpapractice.

Now that she thinks of it--parang too much of a coincidence naman ata na at this time of the day palaging nag-aayos si Eula sa ilalim ng puno ng mangga na malapit sa volleyball court?

"Sino ba sa kanila ang crush mo?" Tanong niya rito while roaming her eyes around the guys.

"Wala nga!" Eula hissed.

"Sus. Kunwari ka pa. So who is it? Si number 17 ba?"

 

Number 17--tall and moreno guy. Short, clean cut hair. He looks okay.

 

Eula shook her head. "Wala nga."

 

"Si number 5 ba?" Tanong ulit ni Dama. Si number 5 ay mas maliit ng di hamak sa mga kasama nito. He was also the cutest. Pansin ni Dama na mahilig itong ngumiti kahit minsan ay sablay ang tira nito sa bola.

"Hindi nga." Pagtanggi ni Eula. Sakto naman that the ball flew near them. Tumakbo palapit si number 5 para i-retrieve iyon. 

At ang pasaway na bola, sa may paanan ni Eula tumigil.

 

"Miss! Pasalo naman! Salamat!" Nakangiting pakiusap ng lalaki sa kanila. Eula blushed scarlet and pretended to not hear the guy. Inuntag naman sya ni Dama.

 

"Huy... yung bola daw."

"Eeee... ikaw na magbigay." Nakatungo nitong sagot.

"Ayoko nga. Tinatamad ako. Ikaw na lang."

Eula looked helplessly at her. Nang hindi matinag si Dama ay wala na syang nagawa kundi kunin ang bola at iabot iyon sa lalaking nakikiusap.

 

"Salamat!" Masayang sabi nito sa kanya.

 

Dama saw her friend hold up her giggle until she was back to her seat. 

"So si number 5 nga?" Nakangis nyang tanong dito.

"Oo na." Pag-amin ni Eula. "Wag mong ipagsasabi kahit kanino ah?"

"Why not tell him? Para hindi naman sayang yang pagpapa-cute mo sa kanya."

Eula sighed.

 

"May girlfriend na kase sya."

 

Awww... look little organ--may karamay ka ulit.

 

"Ganun ba? Sayang naman..."

Ngumiti na lang si Eula. "Ganun talaga eh. Yung mga kagusto-gusto yung hindi na available." Nalulungkot nitong sabi sa kanya.

"Oo nga." Pagsang-ayon niya.

 

Sabay silang napabuntong-hininga.

 

"O? Ang aga-aga, buntong-hininga agad? Problema nyo?"

Dumating na pala si Zelo... kasama ang girlfriend nito na as usual ay parang tuko na naman kung kumapit. Gusto na talaga ni Dama na manabunot.

Problema ko? Ikaw!

"Wala." Sagot niya sa pinsan.

Naupo ito sa tabi niya. Naupo naman si Tassie sa tabi nito. Magkahawak pa ng kamay ang dalawa.

"Wala pa sina Keeme?" Tanong ni Zelo sa kanya.

"Nakita mo ba?" Pabalbal niyang sagot dito. She can't help it eh... lumalabas yung frustration niya everytime na makikita nya si Zelo at Tassie--usually one with the other.

"Tinatanong kita ng maayos ha."

"Eh nakita mo na kaseng wala, tinatanong mo pa!"

 

"Oy oy... umagang-umaga ang iinit agad ng dugo nyo!" Saway ni Eula sa dalawa.

"Hayaan mo na... ganyan silang magmahalan eh." Natatawang sabat ni Tassie.

 

Aray naman.... so ganito pala kami magmahalan? Bulyawan at sakitan ang peg? Kayo lang ang sweet? , she thought bitterly.

 

Don't worry little heart... I'll find someone for you too.





xxxxxxxx

AN: Namiss ko ulit si Dani--at Meg. Haha... ayan. Silip lang ulit sa kanila. Antayin nyo si Pierre!!!! Malapit na sya dumating!!!! Mga 20 chapters pa! Hahaha...

Comment? Happy 800 votes. :>

I hope I can make you smile like this camera.

--


Lumilipas ang mga araw at ang pakiramdam ng dalaga ay lumalala. It's true that love is like a quicksand. It's slowly dragging you down into it's depth and the more you struggle, the more you'll sink in.

Paano ba mapipigilan ang sariling mahulog sa isang tao?

Mahirap.

Kaya pabayaan mo na lang. You'll get hurt anyway so just learn to enjoy the fall. Your heart will break, that's for sure. But it's better to be broken than to have not love at all. Tears will come running and your eyes will be puffed but in the end, it will make you tough.

Love not with your head for it is impossible. Love with all your heart even if it makes you gullible.

Love... *le sigh*... nagiging makata na naman tuloy si Author.

 

Balik tayo sa ating bida na kanina pa naiinggit sa mag-boyfriend na nasa katabing upuan lang. Nakaupo kase sina Tassie at Zelo tapos nagsi-share ng headset ang dalawa habang nilalaro-laro ni Zelo yung kamay ni Tassie.

Hindi naman palangiti ang binata but there's always this hint of smile whenever he's with her.

 

When will you smile at me like that Zelo?

 

Dama sighed when she felt the familiar pang of jealousy eat her up inside. She decided to go off somewhere... anywhere. Yung walang sweetness. Yung damang-dama niya ang pagiging mag-isa.

Sa kalalakad nya, napadpad sya sa may auditorium ng school. Sa gilid noon, she saw a guy who immediately caught her attention. Ang cool lang kase nitong tingnan with his spiky hair and white rubber shoes.

And he smokes too--not that she cares about that. Smoker or not, as long as you're hot--you got her full attention.

 

Nilapitan nya ito.

"Hi."

Tiningnan sya ng lalaki mula ulo hanggang paa. "Sino ka?"

"I'm Dama. And you are...?"

"Rodney." Sagot nito sa kanya. The guy blew off some air bago sya tiningnan nitong muli. "May kailangan ka ba?"

"Actually... may girlfriend ka na?" Deretsahan nyang tanong dito.

Natawa ang lalaki. "Ano ka? Namimick-up?"

"I guess you could say that. Kelangan ko lang ng distraction eh. So... are you game?"

Tiningnan syang muli ng lalaki mula ulo hanggang paa.

"Ano namang mahihita ko sa 'yo?" Tanong nito.

Pinamay-awangan nya ito. "Aba... just being with me is like winning the lottery already! You should feel proud na ikaw ang natipuhan kong alukin ng offer na yan!"

"Proud?" The guy scoffed. "Bakit? Ano ka ba sa school na 'to para maging proud ako? Ni hindi nga kita kilala."

"Basta! Boyfriend na kita mula ngayon." She said in finality.

Napanguso ang lalaki. "Hoy! Sino'ng may sabi sa 'yong pumapayag ako?"

"Sige na!" Pakiusap nya rito.

"Ayoko! Hassle lang yan!"

"Sige na!" Hinila-hila nya ang braso ng lalaki. "Libre kitang lunch everyday!"

 

"Kahit magkano?" Agad na tanong ng lalaki.

"Basta 25 pesos ang cut-off ko."

"50." The guy bargained.

"30."

"35."

"Hanggang 30 lang! Wala akong pera..." Hindi matanggap ng dalaga na wala syang pera. ang saklap lang. Ni hindi pa sya nakakahawak ng 30 pesos sa buong buhay nya--ngayon pa lang. All she have with her are her credit cards and cheques... ang cash nya--lilibuhin. Barya? Tig-iisang daan.

She felt poorer than a beggar tuloy--although she haven't met one. Hinaharang na ng guards nya papalapit pa lang...

The guy sighed. "Sige. Fine. Basta araw-araw ha? Walang palya!"

"Oo." She assured him.

 

Iniabot ng lalaki ang kamay nito sa kanya.

"Ano'ng gagawin ko dyan?" Tanong niya rito.

"Shake hands."

She accepted it.

 

--

 

Nagulat ang mga kaibigan ni Dama ng makitang may kasama na itong boyfriend during lunch time.

"Sino yan?" Halos sabay-sabay nilang tanong.

"Boyfriend ko." Sagot nya.

"HA?!"

"Kelan pa?"

"Nagpaligaw ka man lang ba?"

"Bakit sya?"

Sunod-sunod nilang tanong.

 

Naupo si Dama habang inutusan naman nya ang boyfriend na bumili ng makakain nila. 

"Pano kayo nagkakilala? Saka kelan? Parang kanina wala ka pang boyfriend ah?" Concerned na tanong ni Eula. Hindi naman maiiwasang hindi maging concerned. Parang nag-magic lang kase si Dama tapos poof--may boyfriend na sya.

"Kanina lang. Sa may auditorium." She replied casually.

"Adik ka ba?!" Pagtataas ng boses ni Lei. "Eh kung rapist pala yan? Hila ka ng hila ng kung sinu-sinong di mo naman kilala!"

"Masyado ka lang judgmental Lei." She replied to her friend.

"Magagalit si Zelo sa 'yo." Sabi naman ni Eli.

"At bakit? Sya lang ang may karapatang magkajowa?"

 

Nailing bigla si Keeme. "Sinasabi ko na nga ba eh. Naiinggit ka lang sa pinsan mo."

"Is that the case Dama? Naiinggit ka kay Zelo kase sya may girlfriend?" Kunot-noong tanong ni Eula sa kanya.

 

Hindi no. Naiinggit ako kay Tassie kase sya ang girlfriend ni Zelo at hindi ako, she wanted to say.

 

"Oh? Bat naririnig ko yata ang pangalan ko? Ano'ng meron?" Kakadating lang ni Zelo. Dama sighed in relief ng makitang hindi nito kasama ang possessive nitong girlfriend. But at the same time, kinabahan sya bigla.

Siguradong mapapagalitan nga sya ng pinsan kapag nalaman nito ang mga pinag-gagagawa nya.

 

"Si Dama kase... may boyfriend na."

Zelo looked confused at first. Di kalaunan ay bigla itong natawa. He pointed at Dama. "Ikaw? Sino namang papatol sa 'yo?"

"Ako." Lalong lumakas ang kaba ni Dama ng marinig ang boses ni Rod--was it Roderick or Rodger? She can't even remember his name!

She saw Zelo throw dagger looks at the guy. 

 

Oh my--are you jealous? Secretly, she felt kilig when she saw his reaction. Ahhh... priceless!

 

"Nag-boyfriend ka na agad ni hindi mo nga mamaintain yung grades mo." Pabulong na reklamo ni Zelo.

"Eh bakit ba? Sa gusto kong mag-boyfriend eh."

"Naiinggit yan sa 'yo Zelo." Sabat ni Keeme.

Nagkatinginan ang magpinsan. Biglang namula si Dama.

"Naiinggit ka?" Tanong sa kanya ni Zelo.

"Di ah." Tanggi nya.

"Inggitera ka talaga kahit kelan."

 

Sinimangutan nya ito. Masama bang mainggit kay Tassie? Eh ang swerte swerte nya sa 'yo. Dama mentally cursed. Eto na naman sya eh... kaya hindi sya maka-move on sa namumuong pagtingin nya sa lalaki ay dahil dito--her heart and mind refuses to cooperate.

Saklap.

"Kumain na nga lang tayo." Saway sa kanila ni Lei. Nasense kase nito na wala na namang patutunguhan ang away nilang magpinsan.

 

--

 

Ilang araw pa lang ang nakalilipas... namumulubi na si Dama. Bukod kase sa lunch nya eh kailangan pa nyang bumili ng lunch para sa boyfriend nya.

Mukhang wala naman itong epekto kay Zelo--lalo na sa kanya. Yung kinuha nyang distraction... hindi distracting enough.

 

--

 

Saturday. 

Tinanghali ng gising si Dama dahil napuyat ito pakikipag-usap sa daddy nya over the phone. Di nya alam ang mararamdaman about what he said to her about her mom.

Namimiss na daw kase sya nito. Hindi tuloy nya maisip kung pinaglalapit lang ba silang dalawa ng mommy nya o kung totoo ba.

Namimiss sya ng mommy nya?

 

Wow... that's new.

 

Naabutan nyang natutulog ang pawisang si Zelo sa upuan na pangmahirap. Naka-stretch ulit ito doon habang pawisan. Nilapitan nya ito at pinagmasdan.

Why do you look so grim? Are you having a bad dream Zelo?

She perched on the table.

Are you dreaming of me kaya hindi ka makangiti?

 

She smiled with bitterness.

Napapitlag sya ng maramdamang may nag-vibrate sa may hita nya. She looked beneath her. Phone pala ni Zelo--yung pangmahirap nitong phone--may tumatawag.

Si Tassie.

 

Sasagutin na sana nya iyon ng biglang mag-end yung call. As she was about to put it down, nag-vibrate na naman ito.

She pressed the accept button.

"Hello?"

"Dama? Nandyan ba si Zel? Pakausap naman please..."

"Tulog sya eh."

"Ah ganun ba?" She heard Tassie sigh on the other end.

"Problema?"

 

Naghintay sya ng sagot nito.

 

"May nakikwento ba sa 'yo si Zel?"

"Na ano? Wala naman..." Ni hindi nga ito nakikipag-usap sa kanya... kikwentuhin pa kaya?

"Ilang araw nya na kase akong hindi pinapansin eh. Ewan ko nga kung kami pa ba..." Tassie's voice trailed off.

 

Little organ! Masyado pang maaga para mag-celebrate!

 

Lumakas na naman kase ang tibok ng puso nya out of excitement.

"Dama... pwedeng favor?"

"Yes?"

"Pasabi naman kay Zel kausapin nya 'ko ha? Hindi ko kase alam kung ano'ng problema namin eh."

Ayoko nga, she wanted to say. Magbreak na kase kayo.

 

"Okay." Pero kagaya ng dati... iba na naman ang lumabas sa bibig nya.

"Thank you. Bye."

 

Inilapag nya ang phone sa lamesa. Saka sya napabuntong-hininga.

Little organ... I can finally see a glimmer of hope.

 

Hinawakan nya ang dibdib.

Pero 'wag tayong masyadong umasa ha?

 

"Si Tassie yun?"

Nagulat sya ng mapansing gising na ang pinsan. Nakaupo na nga ito at nagpupungas.

"Oo." She replied.

"Ano'ng sabi?"

"Kausapin mo daw sya."

"Ah..." Sagot lang nito. Zelo stood up and went to the kitchen. Sinundan sya ni Dama.

 

"Nag-away kayo?" Tanong nya.

"Hindi."

"Nagkatampuhan?"

"Hindi." 

"Eh bakit hindi mo sya kinakausap?"

 

He turned to face her. He was wearing his usual bored, none-of-your-business look.

"Wala kang pakialam."

[18] Chapter 17
*******************************************
I'm tired of being good. Let's be bad?

--


"Mama, quit calling him. Makukulitan na yun sa 'yo." Saway ni Enzo sa asawa. They were back at the mansion dito sa Pilipinas. Mag-iilang linggo na rin. At napansin lang nya na halos maya't maya kung tumawag si Angel sa anak na naiwan sa Japan.

Tingin nya ay nainis na rin ang anak nito dito at hindi na ito sumasagot sa mga tawag ng asawa niya. Masyado kaseng worried si Angel na iwan ang anak mag-isa sa ibang bansa.

"Papa... he's not answering my calls! What if something happened?" Mangiyak-ngiyak na tanong nito sa kanya.

"He's fine. Nakukulitan lang yun sa 'yo. Pamiss ka naman kase ng konti ma."

Angel pouted. "Baka naman kase hindi na sya kumakain ng tama dun papa. I just want to check on him."

"He just posted an intagram pic of him eating a bowl of ramen. He's fine ma. He's enjoying his time being alone."

Angel tossed her phone on the bed and collapsed beside it. Naupo si Enzo sa tabi nito and then he leaned close to her.

Ngumiti sya.

"Gumawa pa kase tayo ng isa para may aalagaan kang bago." He said with a lopsided grin plastered on his boyish face.

Angel let out a chuckle. "It's been ten years na since Anzo no?"

"Yep. Ikaw kase, ayaw mo agad sundan."

Angel rolled her eyes at her husband. It's not that they're not having sex naman within that ten years... kaso she's been too careful not to get pregnant. Bukod sa first time nyang maging mommy at nangangapa pa sya, natatakot na rin syang manganak ulit. Nandun na sya sa fulfilling kapag nakita mo yung anak mo... but it was so painful.

Inaalala pa lang nya, parang bumabalik lahat ng physical pain.

 

"Mama..."

"Oh?"

Enzo leaned closer. "May utang ka pa sa 'kin."

Kumunot ang noo ni Angel. "Magkano?"

That made him laugh.

"What?" Takang-tanong ng asawa nya. "What's so funny?"

Enzo grinned. "Hindi naman pera ang utang mo eh. Remember our deal? Minimum of ten kisses everyday. I only got 8 yesterday."

"Weh? Ten kaya."

"Eight lang mama. Bilang na bilang ko yun eh."

"Ten yun pa. Eleven pa nga yata. Bilang ko din yun so when I realized na kulang... nikiss kita while you were asleep." Paliwanag ni Angel.

"Daya. Eh di hindi ko alam?"

"Eh di ngayon alam mo na."

Enz made a sour face. "Hindi dapat counted yun eh..." Pag-aalboroto nito.

Angel sighed and held his face with her hands. Saka sya nito hinila for a short kiss. She did that 4 times before she stopped to smile at him.

Hindi naman nakuntento si Enzo. He dipped his head once more and kissed her.... harder than the previous once. Angel can't help but moan.

"Papa..."

Enzo's lips trailed her jaw. "Hmmm?"

"Di ba makikipameet pa tayo kina kuya?"

 

Natigilan si Enzo. Saka lang nya naalala... may dinner nga pala sila with his sister and Dani.

"I totally forgot." Pag-amin niya sa asawa. Nasasarapan na kase sya sa paghalik dito kaya nawala na sa isip nya ang iba pang bagay na kailangan nilang gawin ngayong araw.

"Oh... now that you're reminded, kindly please get off me para makapag-ready na tayo." Angel said.

He didn't move.

 

"Pa-cancel na lang kase natin."

"Hindi pwede! Magagalit si Meg... alam mo naman yun eh..."

He sighed. "Fine. We'll continue this later ha?"

"Papa..."

"Say yes mama and we'll get ready for dinner."

"Papa naman..."

"I'm serious." Enz said in a very serious tone. "I want another kid."

Angel blushed scarlet. "Papa naman eh..."

Biglang lumungkot si Enzo. "Ayaw mo na ba?"

"Hindi naman sa ayaw papa." She sighed again. "Can we just talk about it later?"

"Talk lang?"

Angel laughed. "Fine. Lasingin mo ako mamaya."

 

--

 

Agad na hinanap ni Dani ang asawa pagkarating na pagkarating pa lang ng bahay. He didn't see her outside the house, which is where she usually was when he comes home para salubungin sya.

Wala rin ito sa sala.

"Manang, si mommy asan?"

"Nasa kwarto sir." Sagot ng katulong. He didn't need to specify who mommy is dahil isa lang ang mommy at daddy sa bahay nila... at sila iyong mag-asawa.

After so many years, the people at the house still find it sweet.

 

Agad na pumunta si Dani sa kwarto nilang mag-asawa.

"Mommy?" He called out. Walang sumagot. Frowning, he looked for her at the shower. Wala rin ito doon. He was about to look to the other rooms when he heard a grunt coming from their walk-in closet.

Sumilip sya sa nakabukas na pinto and he was greeted by the sight of his wife... in her underwear. She has her back on him and she seemed to be so engrossed on her thoughts that she didn't even hear him sneak inside.

 

Napasinghap ito when he squeezed her butt.

"Dad! You startled me!"

He nuzzled her neck. "What are you doing?"

"Wala kase akong mapiling damit dad."

Iniharap nya sa kanya ang asawa. "Wala? Sa dami ng damit mo wala kang napili?" Takang-tanong niya rito.

"Kase dad, gusto ko mas maganda ako kay Angel mamaya."

 

Natawa si Dani sa sinabi ng asawa. "Mommy, hindi naman nakikipagpagandahan sayo si Anj ah?"

"Eh kahit na. Basta gusto ko mas maganda ako sa kanya."

He kissed her cheek. "Alam mo namang ikaw ang pinakamaganda sa 'kin di ba?"

Megan smiled sheepishly. "Ako LANG naman ang maganda para sa'yo eh, di ba dad?"

"Oo naman. Kahit pa nga parang tumataba ka mommy." Pinisil nya ang tagiliran nito.

 

Megan instantly looked worried. "Tumataba na ako? Kelangan ko na bang mag-diet daddy?"

"No. Mas maganda nga kung magkakalaman ka ng konti pa. More parts for me to squeeze."

"Nangmamanyak ka na naman dad."

 

Tumawa si Dani. "Eh kase naman, maaabutan pa kitang nakaganyan pagdating ko sa bahay? Buti nga hindi kita sinunggaban eh."

"Eh kase kanina pa ako nag-iisip ng isusuot ko for our dinner with those two."

"Relax mommy." He kissed her forehead. "Any dress will suit you just fine."

"Thanks daddy. Magbihis ka na rin okay?"

Hinalikan sya nito sa labi.

"Okay."

 

--

 

At the restaurant, masayang nagkumustahan ang apat na akala mo naman ay hindi nagkita nung isang linggo. Megan was wearing Shantung silk one shoulder red dress. She paired it with her sharp black prada stilletos and a black purse.

Si Angel naman, suot suot nya ang isang white striped Anglomania sunday dress from Vivienne Westwood. Sa suot pa lang ng dalawang babae, malalaman mo na kung sino'ng mabait at hindi.

 

"So how's Dama?" Tanong ni Enzo sa mag-asawa.

"I don't know and I don't care." Sagot ni Megan sa kapatid.

"She's doing well actually. Madalas nya akong itext just to tell me about her day." Dani answered.

"Tinitext ka nya dad?" Gulat na tanong ni Megan sa asawa. "Bakit sa 'kin hindi man lang sya nagpaparamdam?"

Natawa si Dani sa reaction ng asawa. "See? You miss her. You took the bait."

Meg grunted. "I hate you dad." Tumawa naman ang nakababatang mag-asawa sa kanilang dalawa.

 

Later on... they were served by Kent and France... the usual tandem. Although this time, nasa paligid lang ang mga asawa ng mga ito.

Kent's wife is almost 6 months pregnant with their second child. Yung kay France naman, pangatlo na.

There's this air between the four of them na para bang may something na ewan. Of course, Meg didn't pry but she somehow knows... there is something. A thing of the past maybe?

 

They ate and talk after being served. Nasa main course na sila ng biglang ibinagsak ni Meg ang knife and fork nito.

"Mommy what's wrong? Didn't you like the food?"

Napangiwi si Megan. "It tastes funny dad." 

"Are you okay Meg?" Tanong naman ni Angel dito.

"I think I have to go to the ladies' room. Excuse me."

"Samahan na kita." Angel offered. Tumayo ang dalawang babae from their seats at saka nagpunta sa washroom.

 

--

 

Thirty minutes later (to the dismay of the guys), bumalik na rin ang dalawang babae.

"Bakit ang tagal nyo?" Iritableng tanong ni Enz.

Nagkatinginan ang dalawang babae.

"We... discovered something." Sagot ni Angel.

"What?" Nagpalipat-lipat ang tingin ni Dani sa asawa at kapatid.

 

Hinawakan ni Meg ang kamay nya and then she looked him in the eye.

 

"Dad... I'm pregnant."

 

--

 

Bahay ng mga Dirham.

After hearing the news, hindi na pinatagal ni Dani ang dinner. Iniuwi na nya kaagad ang asawa. He was so ecstatic na parang gusto nyang magtatalon sa tuwa. Pati mga katulong tuwang-tuwa rin sa balita.

Lalo na si Lolo Stephen!

 

Dani sat on the edge of the bed saka nya hinila si Meg paupo sa lap nya.

"I can't wait to be a dad again."

"Dad last na 'to ha? Ayoko ng manganak ulit. Pahabol lang 'to."

Sumimangot si Dani. "Last na?" Tanong nya na may bahid ng reklamo.

"Oo last na talaga."

 

He lifted her up and laid her gentlydown on the bed. Then he removed her shoes and went on top of her.

"Mommy... do you think that there's a chance na magawa pa nating kambal yan?"

Meg gaped at him. "Daddy!"

"Eh sabi mo kase last na eh. Sana maging dalawa yan after tonight."

"Dad! Hindi na mangyayari yun! Nabuo na eh!"

Dani chuckled. "Why did you suddenly become tensed? I'm just kidding." He stooped down and kissed her. "I love you mommy."

"Love you too."

"Pwede bang testingan natin kung magiging kambal pa yan?" Hirit ni Dani sa asawa. Hinampas sya nito sa balikat.

"Adik ka dad!"

"I'm serious."

 

Meg sighed. "Dad... I don't know how she'll take it."

"Ni Dama?" He asked.

 

--

 

"Achu!"

Dama sniffed as the cold evening air sent shivers down her spine. Kasama nya ang boyfriend nya who insisted that they go to the primary school after class. Magdi-date daw sila.

"Ang cheap mo. Date... sa school? Tss."

"Wag ka ng magreklamo. Buti nga dinidate pa kita eh."

Dama rolled her eyes as they continued walking.

 

Nang makarating sa school, she wanted to go home instead. Malapit na rin lang naman ang bahay nila doon. Mga limang kanto lang. Madilim na sa school at wala pang katao-tao.

She wondered how their date will be given na wala man lang resto sa tabi ng school na pwedeng kainan.

"Wag na lang kaya tayong tumuloy?"

Rod tsk-ed and pulled her by the hand. Dun na sya kinabahan. It's like... something is about to go wrong. So wrong...

 

Hinila sya nito papunta sa isang classroom. He even knows how to pick the lock. Itinulak sya nito papasok sa loob.

"Anong gagawin natin dito?"

He sighed. "Tanga ka ba o nagtatanga-tangahan? Natural magse-sex. Hubad na!"

Napanganga na lang si Dama sa narinig.

"You can't be serious?!"

"Seryoso ako." She heard the sound of his belt unbuckling.

"No way!" Mariiin nyang tanggi. She did not plan on dying a virgin but still--she wants her first to be out of love... not like this!

She felt Rod grab her by the shoulder then pushed her pahiga sa teacher's table.

"H-Hey!"

"Girlfriend kita di ba?" Pilit nitong binubuksan ang blouse nya.

"Ano ba! Stop it!"

"Wag ng maarte!" Sigaw nito sa kanya.

 

Zelo...

 

Gusto nyang isigaw ang pangalan ng pinsan. Deep inside her little organ, she was wishing that he would just magically appear out of nowhere and just save her. Pero impossible naman yata iyong mangyari.

"Just... stop!" She sobbed.

Tumigil si Rodney at napamura.

"Ano ba? Akala ko ba game ka? Ikaw nga itong basta-basta na lang nanghihila ng lalaki para manging boyfriend tapos sex lang iniiyakan mo na?"

Hindi sya sumagot. She was pained by a certain fact. The sad fact that if ever things like this would happen to her, no one would come at her rescue.

Ni wala man lang mag-aalala.

 

She was so alone... all alone.

 

"Sorry." Narinig nyang inis ngunit seryosong sabi ni Rodney. "Manyak lang ako. Pasensya na. Akala ko lang kase--putangina--next time nga 'wag ka ng manghihila ng lalaki kung saan saan ha? Pasalamat ka nakonsensya ako ngayon."

She heard him zip his pants up.

"Break na tayo." Dagdag nito.

 

She managed to stand up and fix herself.

"T-Thank you." Nasabi na lang niya bago tuluyang nakaallis ang binata. She wanted to laugh at herself. The first time she had ever said thanks to someone... yung sa muntik pang mang-rape sa kanya.

Hinanap nya ang bag na napabagsak kung saan. Lumabas sya ng classroom at ini-lock iyon then she slowly made her way home.

 

Tama na little organ. Stop hoping for him. He can't be yours anymore.

 

xxxxxx

AN: Nakapag-UD rin sa wakas!!! COMMENTS? ^^

Salamat sa mga readers na maingay sa group ha? Nakakatuwa talaga kayo. Haha.. Para sa inyo 'to. Good night!

[19] Chapter 18
*******************************************
Just like the alphabet bitch, I come before U.

--


Walang pinagsabihan ng nangyari si Dama. It's not because she's traumatized from what had happened. She just have this sick feeling na wala rin namang mababago kapag sinabi nya sa kanila ang nangyari.

Feeling nya magagalit lang sila sa kanya dahil sa katangahan nya. Kasalanan nya naman eh. Kung hindi sya nanghila ng kung sinong lalaki eh hindi mangyayari sa kanya iyon.

Bottom line... sa kanya lang mapupunta ang sisi.

 

"Uy Dama, di ka na naman sasama pagkain?" Untag sa kanya ni Eula. Lunch na kase. Hindi man lang nya namalayan na tanghali na pala. Kanina pa sya nakatulala... nag-iisip.

Umiling sya sa kaibigan at saka nagpangalumbabang muli.

Kahapon pa nagwo-worry sa kanya ang barkada. She wasn't her usual self. Hindi nya sinalubong ng okray ang pagkasemi-kalbo ni Keeme. Nag-try kase ito ng new hairstyle.

Hindi rin nya pinansin ang pagiging malapit ni Lei sa dati nitong boyfriend.

 

Wala syang pinapansin sa kanila. Ni hindi nga sya nagsasalita.

 

"Dama... may problema ka ba?" Nag-aalalang tanong ni Eli.

"Wag mong sabihing dinidibdib mo yung pagbi-break nyo ng boyfriend mo?" Singit naman ni Lei.

 

Dama sighed pero hindi sya sumang-ayon o tumanggi. Nanatili lang syang tahimik. What's the use in talking anyway? Sasabihin lang nila na ang tanga-tanga nya.

She's tired of being reprimanded. Buong buhay nya, palagi na lang syang pinagagalitan. Wala na syang nagawang tama. Sawang-sawa na sya.

And besides, it's not as if they really care about me. Little organ, why am I so alone?





"Dama gusto mong sumama sa mall?"

Napabuntong-hininga syang muli. Bakit ba ang kukulit ng mga kabarkada nya? Bakit hindi na lang sya iwang mag-isa ng mga ito? Tutal sanay na sanay na naman syang nag-iisa.

"Sama ka na." Pamimilit sa kanya ni Eula. "May sale sa Metro. Tingin tayo!" Nakangiti nitong sabi. Muntik ng mapagulong ang mata nya sa narinig. SALE? Pang-mahirap na word. Never pa syang pumunta sa isang SALE. Ni hindi sya nag-aavail ng items na may discount.

Para sa kanya, mahihirap lang ang may karapatang humingi ng discount.

She looked at Eula's eager face and she suddenly remembered number 5--ang crush ni Eula. Sa lahat halos sa barkada nila, ito ang pinakang nakakarelate sa kanya. And besides, ito rin ang pinaka-close nya sa kanila.

"Sige na nga." Sa huli ay sabi nya.

 

Eula beamed at her. Nilingon naman ni Keeme si Zelo.

"Ikaw Zelo?"

Umiling ang binata. "Next time na lang."

"Maglalunch kayo ni Tass?" Tanong ni Eula.

"Oo eh."

"Ah... okay. Tara Dama?" Aya ni Eula sa kanya. Tumayo sya at sumunod sa mga kaibigan. Paglabas ng school, sumakay sila sa jeep na nakaparada sa may gate. Magkakatabi sila nina Eli at Lei. Sa katapat naman nila halos nakaupo sina Keeme at Eula.

Puno na halos ang jeep ng may sumakay na matabang babae. Schoolmate nila iyon, based on her uniform. Sumiksik ito sa tabi ni Eula.

"Pwedeng pakiusod naman ng konti?" Medyo iritado nitong sabi kay Eula.

Eula tried to move pero wala na eh... siksikan na.

"Pausod naman! Pare-pareho lang naman tayong nagbabayad eh!" Pabulyaw nitong sabi. Nagkakatinginan na ang magkakaibigan.

 

"Bakit ka kase sumiksik? Alam mo namang hindi ka kasya!"

 

Nagulat ang lahat at napatingin sa kanya.

"Ano'ng sabi mo?"

Dama rolled her eyes. "Didn't you see the space? Kita mo ng kalahati mo lang ang kasya nagpumilit ka pa rin. You should take your fat ass into consideration, you know."

Napamaang ang mga kasama sa kanya. 

"Manong para!" Sigaw ng matabang babae. The jeep came to an abrupt halt and everybody waited for the girl to unboard.

Tumayo ito at dahan-dahang lumabas ng jeep... dragging Dama by the hair on her way out. Halos magkagulo ang lahat dahil sa nangyari. Agad na sumunod sina Eula para tulungan ang kaibigan.

 

The next thing she knew, iningungudngod na ng matabang babae ang mukha nya sa sementong daan a few meters away from the school. Nakasabunot ang babae sa kanya at hindi nya naman ito malabanan dahil hindi sapat ang lakas nya.

Pilit na inihihiwalay nina Keeme at Eli ang babae sa kaibigan. 

Mabuti na lamang at may teacher na nakakita. Inawat nito ang dalawang babae at pinagsabihan. Inis na umalis ang matabang babae habang naiwan si Dama na puro buhangin ang katawan at mukha. Nagkagasgas din ang pinsgi nya at sugat-sugatan ang labi.

Masakit din ang anit nya dahil sa natamong sabunot.

 

Pero ang nakakapagtaka.... hindi man lang sya umiyak. She didn't feel like crying at the moment. She felt empty. The only thing that reminded her that she's still alive was the pain cursing all over her body.

She even rejected her friends' help and went home by herself.

 

She was thankful na walang tao sa bahay pagdating niya. At least she could cry all she want. There's that sick feeling again. Should she tell her dad? And what will he say? What will her mom say? For sure, nagpapakasaya sila ngayon back at their house while she was gone.

Wala talagang nagmamahal sa 'kin little organ. I should have let that girl tear me to pieces.

Dama wondered kung ano ang mangyayari if ever she dies early. May pupunta kaya sa libing nya? Ilan? Mga katulong ba at kasama sa bahay ang karamihan?

Won't they be happy kapag nawala na sya ng tuluyan?

 

She grimaced as she felt her scalp sting. Halos matanggal na ang anit nya sa pagsabunot ng babae kanina. Kasalanan naman nya eh. She was asking for it. Hindi sya inaano nung tao tapos kung ano-ano ang sinabi nya.

But she felt fulfilled.. somehow.

 

"Uy."

She saw her cousin enter the house. Naupo ito sa tabi nya.

"Tsk. Nang-away ka na naman daw? Ayan tuloy ang napala mo."

She didn't answer. She was engrossed with too much pain to speak. Kanina pa sya umiiyak... pati mata nya masakit na.

"Patingin nga." She heard him say. She felt his hand on her chin ng ibaling nito ang mukha nya to see the damage.

Agad nyang inilayo ang mukha nya rito.

"Ano ba'ng problema mo?" Iritado nitong tanong sa kanya.

"Wala." Tumayo sya at akmang pupunta ng kwarto ng hawakan sya nito sa braso.

"Linisin mo muna yan."

 

Kumawala sya mula sa pagkakahawak nito. At dumeretso sa kwarto kung saan nagpatuloy sya sa pag-iyak.

Little organ, hindi ko na yata kaya...

She hugged herself. Sumiksik sya sapinakang-corner ng higaan. At dun sya nag-iiyak. She was on that state when her phone started ringing.

Agad syang nagpahid ng luha ng makita ang tumatawag.

 

Her dad.

 

She cleared her throat several times bago nya ito sagutin.

"Dad?"

"Sweetie! I have great news for you!"

Agad syang naging alerto. Papauwiin na kaya sya ng mommy nya... finally?

"What is it? Can I come home now?"

There was a moment of silence before she heard her dad speak again.

"Sorry sweetie... you still can't come home."

"Oh." Sobrang nakadagdag yun sa disappointment na nararamdaman nya. She covered her mouth to baffle the sound of her cry.

Naiiyak na naman sya.

 

"What's the great news then?"

 

Her dad gave out a giddy laugh before he answered her.

 

"Magiging ate ka na ulit."

 

Dama grasped the phone to the point where it was close to being crushed.

Another one?

She ended the call bago pa marinig ng daddy nya ang iyak nya.

May kahati na naman ako sa pagmamahal little organ? Can't I just have their love and attention to myself?

Ibinaba nya ang aparato bago pa nya ito maibato.

Ayoko na talaga... 

 

--

 

It was around 2am ng magising si Dama. Wala si Meera sa tabi nya when she woke up. Saka lang nya naalala na inilock pala nya ang pintuan kanina.

Why didn't they wake her up?

Nagpungas-pungas sya and winced when her hand brushed her right cheek. Sighing, she opened the door to check on them. Natulog kaya silang lahat sa sala?

She waited for her eyes to adjust in the dark saka nya tiningnan ang natutulog sa sala. 

Huh... bakit sya lang ang nandito?

 

She ignored that fluttery feeling on her stomach and made her way to the kitchen. She heard Zelo grunt when she opened the light. Hindi nya ito pinansin. Naghugas lang sya ng mukha, carefully avoiding the scratches and wounds on her face.

After that, she went back to the bed room to change. Nagsuot sya ng mumurahing yoga pants and a 50 peso spongebob shirt. Saka nya itinali ang buhok into a ponytail.

Lumabas syang muli ng kwarto only to find Zelo sitting already.

"San ka pupunta?" Tanong nito sa kanya.

"Labas." Sagot nya.

"Ano'ng gagawin mo dun?"

 

"Ewan." Pagkasabi'y lumabas sya ng bahay.

Hindi nya alam kung saan nya balak pumunta. Basta gusto nyang mapag-isa. Gusto nyang makaramdam ng lamig. Gusto nyang pumunta sa madilim na lugar. It would suit her heart perfectly... dark, cold and empty.

She was a few steps na away from the house when she felt a piece of clothing being draped on her shoulders.

Jacket?

"Suot mo. Malamig."

Kunot noo nyang tiningnan ang pinsan. "San ka pupunta?" Tanong nya rito.

"Natural sasamahan ka. Alam mong gabing-gabi na tapos ngayon mo pa naisipang gumala? Eh kung may mangyaring masama sa 'yo? Ako na naman ang mapapagalitan."

 

So kasalanan ko na naman?

 

She sighed. Palagi namang nasa kanya ang sisi. Ano pa nga bang bago?

"San ka ba pupunta ha?" Muli nitong tanong sa kanya.

"Sa school." Ang tinutukoy nyang school ay ang elementary school na malapit sa kanila. Sarado naman iyon lalo na't tuwing gabi pero mababa lang kase ang bakod nito kaya madaling pasukin.

Nang marating nila ang school ay doon sila dumaan papasok. Marami kaseng trespassers sa school dahil dinadayo ang playground nito.

Dun sila mismo nagpunta.

 

Naupo ang magpinsan sa swing.

 

"Bakit ka nakipag-away kahapon?" Tanong ni Zelo sa kanya.

"Wala." Sagot nya. "Feel ko lang."

He sighed. "Ganyan ka ba talaga?"

"Oo ganto talaga ako."

 

Why would I change? Nobody loves me anyway.

 

Unti-unti nyang nilalakasan ang pagsi-swing using her feet. When was the last time na nakapunta sya sa isang playground? Ten years ago pa yata.

Nung isilang si Dylan, wala ng inatupag ang mga magulang nya kundi ang pag-aalaga dito. At sya? Katulong ang nag-aalaga.

Katulong ang kalaro.

Katulong ang palaging kasama.

 

Shit. Why are you tearing up?

 

Nagpahid siya ng luha na malapit ng pumatak.

"Umiiyak ka ba?" Tanong nito sa kanya.

"No. Napuwing lang." 

 

Nilakasan nya ang pagsi-swing....

 

"Mahuna na yan. Dahan-dahanin mo lang..." He warned her. Hindi nya ito pinakinggan. Patuloy lang sya sa pagsi-swing. And then she heard the rusty chains creak. Tapos bigla itong napigtal mula sa pinakang puno. Napatilapon tuloy sya sa buhanginan.

"Ouch!"

"Sabi ko naman kase sa 'yo eh! Halika nga!" Inalalayan sya ni Zelo pagtayo. "Ang tigas-tigas talaga ng kokote mo!"

"Aray ko naman!" Reklamo niya ng tuktukan sya nito sa ulo.

"Ikaw kase! Palagi mo na lang kaming pinag-aalala!" Naiirita nitong sabi.

 

Natigilan naman sya sa sinabi nito.

Nag-aalala ka para sa 'kin?





The mere thought of him getting worried over her made her so happy. At last, may taong nag-aalala para sa kanya. Pati sila... nag-aalala rin sa kanya.

Sa sobrang katuwaan nya, nayakap nya bigla ang pinsan.

 

Maybe this is too soon...

 

"Zelo..."

 

And maybe he'll hate me after. Maybe tomorrow, he won't even look at me. Maybe he'll stay away from me.

And maybe I'd get hurt again...




Pero bahala na ang Justice League at Avengers.




Bahala na....























"...gusto kita."

[20] Chapter 19
*******************************************
I wasn't born with enough middle fingers to let you know what I think.

--


Sana pala hindi ko na lang sinabi...





Sising-sisi si Dama sa nangyari earlier today. Nagsisisi sya na nagpadala sya agad sa emosyon niya. Nakakapagsisi rin na sinabi nyang gusto nya ang pinsan knowing all too well na hindi naman sya gusto nito.

Ano pa nga ba'ng magagawa nya? Nasabi nya na eh. And she promised herself that she will accept whatever consequence--should there be any.

At ayun nga, todo iwas sa kanya si Zelo.

Kanina sa hapag kainan, hindi na ito nag-almusal at umalis na lang, saying na kelangan nyang sunduin ng maaga si Tassie.

Sa school, palagi itong nakahiwalay sa kanilang magbabarkada.

Akala nga ng mga kaibigan nila ay magkaaway ang magpinsan. It's a good thing they didn't know any better.

 

Tryouts noon ng department nila for the Intramurals. Malapit na rin kase itong maganap at kailangan nila ng mga manlalaro para sa college nila.

Lakwatsa mode ang mga estudyante sa department nila dahil busy ang mga teacher sa pag-aasikaso ng tryouts at practice. 

Silang magbabarkada--minus Zelo--ay nakatambay sa ilalim ng punong mangga na malapit sa volleyball court. Si Eula ang pumili ng pwesto na yun. Syempre pa, para malapit sya kay number 5. Sa may di kalayuan, nakatambay si Zelo kasama si Tassie at ang mga kabarkada nito. They were laughing about something she said while Zelo was quietly resigned on one corner.

Pasulyap-sulyap lang sa kanya si Dama. Tutal din naman, hanggang tingin lang sya sa lalaki, might as well na sulitin.

 

Hala sige, titigan hanggang matunaw.

 

At dahil sa pinsan sya nakatingin, hindi nya napansin ang bola na papunta sa dereksyon nya. Tumama iyon sa bandang kanan ng ulo nya at kamuntikan na syang matumba.

"Dama! Okay ka lang?!" Eula asked in frantic.

Napahawak siya sa ulo nya. "Aray ko..."

 

"Miss sorry! Okay ka lang ba?"

 

Bibigyan sana nya ng pagkataray-taray na linya ang nagtanong ng mapansin nyang parang nanigas sa kinatatayuan ang kaibigang si Eula.

Kaya pala... si number 5 ang nakatama sa kanya.

"Okay lang..." Mahinahon nyang sagot dito. "Pero itong kaibigan ko hindi." Tinuro nya si Eula.

Tumingin dito si number 5.

"Ha?" Litong tanong nito.

Dama grinned at Eula, na nagsimula ng mamula ang pisngi. "Sya yata ang tinamaan eh."

Halos himatayin si Eula ng hawakan ni number 5 ang ulo nito para i-check kung tinamaan din ba ito. When he was sure na walang tama si Eula, nag-sorry itong muli kay Dama at saka niretrieve ang bola at bumalik sa court.

Gigil na napahawak si Eula sa braso ni Dama at nagpipigil ng kilig.

"Best friend na kita mula ngayon!" Kilig na kilig nitong sabi.

 

Tumawa na lang at dalaga at hindi sinasadyang (o hindi nga ba?) napatinging muli sa gawi ng pinsan.

Her heart almost jumped out her chest ng mapansing nakatingin din ito sa kanya. But when he saw na nakatingin sya rito, he quickly averted his gaze and looked at Tassie instead.

Hindi pa nakuntento ang binata, kinabig nito sa balikat si Tassie at hinalikan ito sa pisngi. Halos maihi sa kilig ang mga kasama nito habang si Tassie naman ay ngingiti-ngiti lang.

Napahawak si Dama sa dibdib ng makaramdam ng pamilyar na sakit.

 

Ayan... tanga ka kase little organ. Magdusa ka ngayon.

 

--

 

Ilang araw na ang lumilipas since that fateful dawn when she decided to reveal her feelings for him. Eto sya ngayon, NGANGA pa rin.

Lalong naging malayo ang loob ng lalaki sa kanya. Ramdam din nina Meera at Manang Pacing yung tension sa pagitan nilang dalawa pero hindi na lang sila nagtatanong. Akala talaga ng lahat ng tao sa paligid nila, magkaaway silang dalawa.

Sa totoo lang, mas gugustuhin pa nga nyang magkaaway na lang ulit sila kesa ganito...

Walang imikan.

Ilangan.

Iwasan.

 

"Ate... kuya... himala yata. Bakit hindi kayo nag-aaway?" Tanong sa kanila ni Meera isang araw. Nanananghalian sila noon.

Hindi sumagot si Dama, bagkus ay nagpaka-busy na lang sya sa pagtatanggal ng laman ng alimango from its shell. Padala daw iyon ng tita Angel nya. Alam kase nitong mahilig sya sa sea food.

Namimiss nya tuloy ang mga katulong niya. May tagakuha kase sya ng laman ng alimango. Pagdating sa kanya ng pinggan niya, laman na lang at kakain na.

Di tulad ngayon... self-service.

 

"Tss." Pasalampak nyang ibinalik sa plato ang alimango na hindi nya makuha-kuha ang laman. Naiinis na kase sya, Bukod sa hindi na nga sya pinapansin ng pinsan ay ginugutom syang lalo sa ulam nila.

Ayaw naman nyang kainin yung kalabasa na kasama sa ulam dahil hindi sya nakain ng kalabasa... or any other vegetable for that matter. Kapag sapilitan lang.

 

Bahagya syang nagulat ng kunin ni Zelo yung alimango mula sa pinggan niya. Hinimay nito iyon at halos pasalong ibinalik ang laman sa pinggan niya.

Hindi naman ito tumitingin sa kanya. 

"Thanks." Mahina nyang sabi.

 

Nagkatinginan na lamang ang mag-ina.

 

--

 

Linggo.

Tinanghali na naman ng gising si Dama. Pero sinasadya na yata talaga yun para hindi makasama sa pagsimba. Alam nya kaseng kapag sumama sya ay makikita lang nya si Tassie... na kasama palagi nina Meera, Zelo at Manang Pacing sa pagsimba.

And besides, it's not as if katanggap-tanggap ang presensya niya sa simbahan.

 

Nagulat sya ng paglabas nya ng kwarto ay naabutan pa nyang natutulog ang pinsan sa pangmahirap nilang upuan.

Aba himala yata? Walang date?


Mukhang puyat na puyat ito. 

 

Ayan little organ, magsawa ka na sa tingin habang tulog pa sya.

 

Nakasandal lang si Dama sa haligi ng pinto ng kwarrto niya habang pinapanuod matulog ang pinsan. Mukhang problemadong-problemado ito. Hindi nya lang alam kung dahil pa sa sinabi niya a few days ago.

Was he that bothered? If so, then what would that mean?

Is being bothered enough for him to reciprocate whatever it is she's feeling for him?

 

Naputol ang pagmumuni-muni ng dalaga ng makitang umilaw ang pangmahirap na phone ni Zelo.  She'd bet anything na si Tassie ang tumatawag.

And she was right.

Mabuti na lang at nakasilent ang phone ni Zelo kaya hindi ito nagigising sa tawag.

 

Nilapitan niya iyon at kinuha.

 

Wow... 15 missed calls? Clingy much? 

 

She answered the call.

"Hello."

"Dama?"

"Natutulog pa sya eh." Sabi niya rito kahit hindi pa man nito naitatanong kung nasaan ang binata.

"Ganun ba? Kaya pala hindi sya sumasagot." 

"May kailangan ka ba?" She asked curtly.

 

She heard Tassie sigh exasperatedly.

"Alam mo ba kung ano'ng problema ng pinsan mo? Ilang araw nya na kase akong hindi kinakausap eh. Ewan ko ba... ang cold cold nya sa 'kin Dama!"

Napataas ang kilay nya.

Cold?

She remembered that day ng bigla na lang hinalikan ni Zelo si Tassie sa harap ng barkada nito. At talagang ipinakita pa nito iyon sa kaya as if to say na hindi sya kundi si Tassie ang gusto nito.

Yun ba ang cold? Eh ano pala 'tong nararanasan ko ngayon... hypothermia? 

"Dama... pwede bang makahingi ng pabor?"

"Sure." Wala sa sarili nyang sagot.

"Pwede bang... kausapin mo si Zelo? Pilitin mo syang magkwento. Hindi ko na kase alam ang gagawin ko eh.... parang ang layo-layo nya."

"Sige."

"Thank you! Sabi na nga ba't maaasahan ka eh!"

"Susubukan ko lang." Wag kang masyadong umasa dyan. Ako nga hindi din kinakausap eh.

 

She ended the call saka sya nagpunta sa banyo para maghulamos. Naghagilap na rin sya ng makakain after. Pandesal lang. Saklap.

Samantalang sa mansion, buffet kung buffet ang breakfast nila. Palaging hindi bababa sa limang putahe ang nakahain. Dito... swerte na kapag dalawa ang ulam sa hapag-kainan.

Kasalukuyan syang nagtitimpla ng kape ng maramdaman nyang may tao na malapit sa kanya.

Nilingon nya ang pinsan na nagpupungas pa.

"Good morning." Bati nya rito.

Tumango lang ito bilang sagot.

"Gusto mo ng kape?"

Umiling ito.

"Tinapay?" Inihaya nya rito ang hawak nyang pandesal. Hindi naman sya pinansin ng lalaki bagkus ay nagpunta ito sa banyo para maghilamos.

Pero ipinagtimpla pa rin nya ito ng kape. Wala lang... nagbabaka-sakali lang na maappreciate nito ang effort nya.

 

Pagkalabas ni Zelo, agad nyang inioffer dito ang kapeng tinimpla nya. Agad naman iyong kinuha ng binata at ininom na para bang malamig na tubig iyon imbes na kape.

"Dahan-dahan! Mainit yan..."

Pagkaubos ni Zelo ng kape ay agad naman nitong sinalinan ng tubig galing sa pitsel ang baso at madalian din iyong ininom.

Nakangiwi ito so she knew already na masakit ang lalamunan nito from the liquid. Aba, eh ikaw ba naman ang tumungga ng mainit na kape?

"Napaso ka?" Concerned nyang tanong dito. Bumuntong-hininga lang ang lalaki.

"Nga pala... tumawag si Tassie. Bakit hindi mo na naman sya kinakausap? Nagtatampo na sa 'yo yung tao eh. Ako tuloy ang kinukulit." Tuloy-tuloy nyang sabi.

Hindi pa rin ito sumagot.

"Nag-away ba kayo ha? Alam mo kung may away kayo, ikaw dapat ang nagso-sorry kahit siya ang may kasalanan. Talk to her. Ayusin nyo yan."

Shit Jiminy Cricket... tumahimik ka nga!

He still didn't answer so she continued.

"What's the use of courting her for so long kung hindi mo naman alagaan ang relationship nyo? Do you really love her or are you just blinded by the idea that you're in love with her? Sort things out between you two, will you? Ayokong ako na naman ang pagbuntunan nya ng sama ng--"

Napatigil ang dalaga sa paglilitaniya ng bigla syang hinawakan ni Zelo sa tigkabilang pisngi. Kung pwede lang talagang malaglag yung puso nya sa sobrang kaba, malamang kanina pa ito bumagsak sa sahig.

She was frantic, giddy, kilig, confused and scared all at the same time.

 

But the kiss didn't come. He simply pressed his hands on her cheeks so hard, namula tuloy ang pisngi ng dalaga.

 

Agad na bumitaw ang lalaki at lumabas ng bahay, naiwan si Dama sa loob... litong-lito. It feels like he was trying to play games with her. Gulong-gulo na ang utak nya.

Little organ, ano ba talaga? 

 

--

 

Sa labas ng bahay...

Mahinang napapalatak ng mura ang binata habang inihihilamos ang kamay sa mukha niya.

 

 

 

Zelo... muntik ka na!

 

xxxxx

AN: Muntik ng ano Zelo ha? Whahaha... I'm so eggzoited for the next UDs to come. Wala lang... gusto ko kase si Zelo para kay Dama... eh kaso may Pierre pa. Papanindigan ko na lang kase yun yung nakalagay sa trailer. Hahaha...

COMMENTS? Salamat po sa 10K reads and 1K votes. Seriously, natatakot ako sa inyo. Kakapost ko pa lang tas para kayong mga piranha na ang bibilis sumunggab. XD

[21] Chapter 20
*******************************************
Let's pretend I give a shit and leave it at that.

--


Give me love like her,

'cause lately I've been waking up alone





Last minute na ng sumali si Dama sa tryouts. Badminton ang sport nya. Wala lang. She badly needs a distraction right now at ayaw naman nyang manghila na naman ng kung sino for that purpose. Nadala na sya.

Wala pa rin silang imikan ni Zelo. They were civil yeah... to the point of abnormality. As in... kung pwede lang na lagyan ng hatian sa bahay para hindi sila magkita, nagawa na nila.

Maagang gigising si Zelo. Magpapatanghali naman sya. Maaga syang darating at kakain agad... magpapalate naman ng uwi ang binata.

It was so obvious that they are avoiding each other sa hindi malamang kadahilanan ng mga tao sa paligid nila.

 

Kaya sumali sya sa laro during Intrams... hoping that it would somehow divert her attention. Well, it was kinda working naman. Until nung mismong laban na niya. Hanap-hanap ng mata nya si Zelo sa mga manunuod.

Kung manunuod man ito, siguradong hindi sya matatalo. Inspired eh.

Pero asa pa naman sya. Kasabay ng laro niya yung laro ni Tassie for volleyball girls. Saklap. Kaya kahit anong gawin nyang pagpupursigi, nalalampaso sya ng kalaban. Hindi sapat ang suporta ng barkada kung yung taong gustong-gusto naman nyang maimpress ay kasalukuyang sumusuporta sa taong gusto nito.

Sobrang saklap lang talaga.

 

Kaya hindi na sya nagtaka ng natalo sya. Wala eh... hindi sya mamotivate lumaban. Bakit ka pa lalaban kung yung tao namang ipinaglalaban mo ay nasa panig ng kalaban mo? Di ba? Senseless.

 

"Sayang best! Konting-konti na lang mananalo ka na eh!" Salubong sa kanya ni Eula. At talagang pinanindigan nito ang pag-angkin sa kanya bilang best friend.

Ngumiti na lang sya dito. "Oo nga eh. Sayang."

"Okay lang yan. Di lang naman ikaw ang malas eh. Talo din sina Tassie."

Nagulat sya sa balita ni Lei. "Ha? Talo sila?"

"Hindi. Panalo. Kaya nga talo eh, di ba? Paulit-ulit?" Pambabara sa kanya ni Lei.

Inirapan nya ito at si Eula ang tinanong. "Talo sila?"

"Ay hindi! Kaya talo eh... panalo!" Tumawa ito. "Joke lang best. Oo. Talo sila."

"Bakit?"

"Puro sablay ang tira ni Tassie."

 

Kumunot ang noo nya. Hindi yata nya maimagine na sasablay ito. Hindi man ito professional player, may potential naman ito sa paglalaro ng volleyball. Dagdag pa na motivated ito dahil nandun si Zelo para manuod at sumuporta.

"Sablay?"

"Distracted kase." Nakangusong sagot ni Eli.

"Distracted?" Taka nyang tanong.

 

"Kahahanap kay Zelo."

 

"Ha?" Lalo na syang nalito.

"Eh kase naman, Ikaw ang sinuportahan ng pinsan mo. Mahal na mahal ka talaga nun ano? Kahit magka-away kayo, pinanuod ka pa rin nya."

Agad na hinanap ng mata ni Dama ang lalaki.

"Wala na. Nakaalis na."

 

Little organ, pinanuod nya 'ko! Arrrgh! Bakit kase nagpatalo ako?!

 

"Kanina pa ba sya nanunuod?"

Tumango si Keeme. "Nandun sya kanina oh." Itinuro nito ang bleachers sa pinakang-sulok ng gym.

"As in?!" Bakit hindi man lang nya ito nakita? May pagka-cameleon ba ito at bigla na lang nag-blend sa surroundings nito o sadyang magaling lang itong magtago?

Bakit ayaw nitong ipaalam sa kanya na nanunuod ito ng laro nya?

 

--

 

 Give a little time to me or burn this out,

We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,

All I want is the taste that your lips allow,

My, my, my, my, oh give me love





Agad na hinanap ni Dama ang pinsan... who turns out to have gone home already. Hinahanap din yata ito ni Tassie kaya umuwi na ito. Hindi na talaga nya masundan ang takbo ng utak ni Zelo. And she's thinking that the only way to understand him is by confronting him.

Bahala na lahat ng super heroes.

She needs to know the real score between them... dahil mababaliw na sya kakaisip. It's like one minute, he likes her. Then he'd turn to be outright cold the next minute.

Di na sya halos makatulog kakaisip.

 

If he doesn't like her the way she likes him, wala na talaga syang magagawa. But at least she knows. Hindi yung kagaya ngayon... hindi nya alam kung saan sya lulugar.

 

Nadatnan nya ang pinsan na nagmemerienda sa kusina. Ito lang ang tao sa bahay. Naaasar na rin sya sa mga kasama nila sa bahay at para bang nananadya talagang umalis para sila lang dalawa ang matira.

Agad na tumigil sa pagkain si Zelo pagkakita sa kanya. 

 

Little organ, 'wag kang maingay ha? Baka matameme ako kapag nag-ingay ka. Sige ka....

 

Naupo sya sa katapat ng binata at ipinatong ang mga gamit nya sa lamesa. She saw his gaze shift left.

"Ano..." Panimula niya.

Dahan-dahang itinulak ni Zelo palapit sa kanya ang plato ng otso na kinakain nito. Yun yung malagkit na kakanin na may tinunaw na asukal sa ibabaw at hugis 8... kaya otso.

"Merienda." He offered.

"Salamat." Kumuha siya ng isa saka kumagat. Sa sobrang lagkit nung asukal, parang na-glue together yung mga ngipin nya. Hindi na tuloy sya nakapagsalita.

Zelo saw that as an opportunity. Tumayo ito at balak sanang umalis. Buti na lang at napigilan nya ito.

 

"Uy teka!"

Pinaupo nya itong muli sa upuan katapat nya. Napabuntong-hininga ito saka sumunod.

"Matutulog ako." Sabi nito ng hindi tumitingin sa kanya. "May sasabihin ka?"

"Ano... thank you. Nanuod ka pala ng laban ko kanina."

"Oo nga eh. Talo ka." He said, tried to sound mean but failed.

"Sorry..." Lungkot na sabi ng dalaga.

"Okay lang." He replied, not really knowing why she's saying sorry.

 

Silence followed.

 

"Bakit di mo pinanuod si Tassie? Natalo tuloy sila." Gusto nyang kagatin ang dila sa tinanong nya. Bakit ba nangingialam pa sya sa gusto ng pinsan? But she really needs to know.

"Hindi naman factor ang presensya ko sa pagkatalo nyo ah?" Sagot nito, still not looking at her.

"Kung nandun ka baka nanalo sila kase gagalingan nya." That's what I was supposed to do, had I known earlier na nanunuod ka.

"Hindi naman ako basehan ng pagkapanalo o pagkatalo nila."

"She was looking for you kaya nadistract sya."

"Hindi ko na kasalanan yun."

 

More silence followed. Ramdam na ni Dama ang sobrang kaba, yung parang sasabog na naman ang little organ niya.

"Mahal mo ba talaga si Tassie?"

 

Tumayo ang binata. "Tulog na 'ko."

 

Dali-daling tumayo si Dama para sundan ang pinsan. Isasara na sana nito ang pintuan ng kwarto ng harangin nya iyon ng kamay nya. Ayun tuloy... naipit.

She yelped in pain. 

"Tss." Inis syang hinila nito papasok ng kwarto. He opened the lights then examined her hand. Naiiyak na sya sa sakit ng kamay. Feeling nya durog na durog na ang mga buto nito kagaya ng pagkadurog ng puso nya.

But of course, she's just exaggerating.

"Masakit?" Tanong nito sa kanya.

She sniffed. "Try mo kayang magpataklab ng pinto sa kamay?" Mataray nyang sagot dito. 

Ginulo nito ang buhok nya. "Okay lang yan. Malayo pa sa puso..." His voice trailed off by itself. Natahimik silang pareho. Wala mang nagsasalita, alam na ng isa't isa ang gusto nilang sabihin.

 

"Bakit kase magmumura ka lang, sa 'kin pa?" Sa wakas ay naitanong ng binata.

"Sorry naman. Sabi ko nga kaya kong pigilan 'to eh." She answered sarcastically.

Zelo sighed. "Binibigyan mo lang ako ng alalahanin eh."

"Sinabi ko ba'ng mag-alala ka? So what if I like you? It's not as if I'm asking you to like me back!"

 

"Yun na nga ang problema eh."

 

Natigilan sya sa sagot nito.

"A-Ano?"

 

For the first time in DAYS, sa wakas ay tumingin na rin ito ng deretso sa kanya. But contrary yet again to what she was hoping and praying to God above...

"Di kita gusto. Asa ka." 

 

And just like that, her tear ducts finally decided to let go.

 

"S-Sorry..." Nagpahid sya ng luha. "Ang sakit kase ng kamay ko." Pagsisinungaling nya. Hindi naman iyon nakaligtas kay Zelo.

Kinabig nya ang dalaga at niyakap.

Then he kissed the top of her head.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Mahal kase kita."

 xxxxxx

AN: Gets ko na yung sinasabi nyong POV ni Zelo. Haha... sige, baka next chapter... insight nya naman. He needs to give a bunch of explanations about this one. Haha...

Sana magustuhan nyo and UD kahit maiksi. I'll be gone for the whole weekend. Baka makapag-OL ako ng Sunday... but I highly doubt it. Sure ang Monday. 

Ayun... COMMENTS? ^^

[22] Chapter 21

Love hurts but I'll love you anyway.

"Mahal kase kita."





Natigilan ang dalaga sa narinig. Even her tears stopped falling. She felt her heartbeat sped up na para bang hinahabol sya ng sampung kabayo.

Did he really mean it? What will she say if he does? Punong-puno ng tanong ang utak nya. 

Kumawala sya sa pagkakayakap ng lalaki. Unable to meet his gaze, tumingin na lamang sya sa Adam's apple nito.

"You're kidding... right?" She asked, unsure.

He let out a loud sigh.

 

Ohmygosh little organ, if he said yes... I'd die!

 

He tilted her chin up with his two fingers. Nagtama ang mga paningin nila. Gustong yumukong muli ni Dama sa sobrang hiya but he didn't let her.

"Mukha ba akong nagbibiro?" Seryoso nitong tanong sa kanya.

Hindi nakasagot ang dalaga. Something seemed to be stuck on her throat at the moment. But she managed to shake her head... 

"B-Bakit--K-Kelan pa?"

 

Zelo averted his gaze. "Matagal na."

 

--

 

Zelo hated it. Hated that feeling towards Dama that keeps on growing more intense as days go by. Pinigilan nya ito. Maraming beses na. He even courted another girl for the hope that one day, he'll be able to let go of his feelings for her.

Mahirap magkagusto sa isang Dirham. Ang dami mong kalaban. There's the press... then those socialites na ang palaging bukang-bibig ay hindi kayo bagay. Nandun yung ibang tao na tingin sa 'yo ay gold-digger o social climber.

Nandun yung insecurity and trampled ego...

 

Lahat-lahat na.

 

Kaya lahat pinilit nyang gawin maiwasan lamang ang dalaga. But fate really has a way of playing pranks on you. Kahit nananahimik ka na nga at walang ginagawa para maka-attract ng kamalasan... mamalasin ka pa rin.

Almost two years ago, Megan talked to him and said that she might need his help to straighten her daughter's attitude. Hindi naman sya makatanggi. Why would he? Suportado ng pamilya Dirham ang pamilya nila. That's the least he can do to show his gratitude.

And so... he hastily thought of ways to kill his feelings for her... He knows that once na mapalapit sa kanya ang dalaga, he'd surely fall for her harder.

Kaya niligawan nya si Tassie. And sometimes, it works. Sometimes, it doesn't. But he's fine. He WAS doing fine... that is... until she came into the picture.

 

He doesn't like Dama at all. In fact, he hates her. He hates the way she screams at the help. He hates the way she gets everything she wants and still has no appreciation for her parents. He hates the way she spends her money on worthless things...

He hates her. And he hates himself even more... because he fell for her inspite all that.

 

"Eeeee... seryoso ba yan?" Tanong sa kanya ng dalaga na nagsimula na namang umiyak. Napasimangot sya. It's not in his nature to be all out sappy and romantic. He was actually been called frigid and cold many times. 

Hindi rin sya sweet... pero kapag may sinabi syang isang bagay that he'll be too embarrassed to admit... that means he's pretty serious.

Kinutusan nya ito. "Seryoso nga sabi."

"Eh bakit ka nananapok?" 

"Eh ikaw kase." Iritado nyang sagot.

"Ang sakit mo namang magmahal." Reklamo nito sa kanya.

Nginitian nya ito saka pinahid ang luha na nasa pisngi nito. "Sorry. Nasanay lang."

 

They both fell silent. Tumungo ang dalaga at pinahid ang natitirang luha sa mata using her hands. He just stared at her. Until now, he couldn't quite fathom the idea of even liking her. Why did he like her in the first place?

Normally, he'd be attracted to someone like Tassie... maganda, mabait at matalino. Not Dama. Pero ayun nga... since his childhood days, palagi na syang nakatingin dito mula sa malayo.

Ang saklap lang. Ilang taon syang ganun.

Then finally... she professed to him.

 

Ang saya nya lang nung time na yun. Gusto nyang magsisigaw sa sobrang saya. But then again, there goes that grave feeling. 

Hindi nya na dapat papatulan ang dalaga but when he saw her cry because of him... hindi nya na napigilang mag-confess.

 

Kaya heto sya ngayon, litung-lito.

 

--

 

Dama woke up feeling her eyes sting. Sa kaiiyak niya, ayan na naman ang mga mata--maga. Kinapa nya ang phone sa bandang ulunan at tiningnan ang oras.

7:15pm

She wondered kung nakauwi na ba ng bahay si Manang Pacing at Meera.

She was about to get up ng maramdaman nyang may nakayakap sa kanya. Halos mapasigaw sya sa gulat.

 

She totally forgot that she fell asleep in his arms earlier that day.

 

"Ayan. Iyak kase ng iyak... inaantok ka na?" Marahan nitong tanong sa kanya ng maghikab sya. She nodded her head sleepily saka sya nahiga sa papag. Maybe he saw her discomfort as she tried to angle her head for it to be rested properly so he offered her his arm.

Dun nya ipinatong ang ulo nya as he embraced her.

"O-Okay lang ba sa 'yo?" Tanong nya sa binata.

She saw him nod. "Matulog ka na." Sabi nito sa kanya.

Isiniksik niya ang ulo sa may leeg ng binata. She saw his Adam's apple go up ang down as he take a gulp. She smiled to herself saka pumikit... hanggang sa nakatulog na sya.

 

Now that she's awake she checked for signs na gising na rin ang katabi. He wasn't. 

"Zel--"

"KUYA!!!"

 

Parang may sumagkid sa lalamunan niya ng marinig ang boses ng batang si Meera. Tantsa niya ay nasa labas na ang mga ito ng bahay.

"Zelo wake up!" She hissed.

Umungot ang binata. "Ano?"

"Nandyan na sila!"

Antok man ay napilitang bumangon ang binata.

"Lalabas na 'ko. Pretend that you're asleep." Utos nito sa kanya. She nodded and laid down the bed again. Saka sya pumikit.

She heard him open the door.

 

Then she felt him kiss her forehead. "Good night." He whispered.

"Kuya!"

"Oy! San kayo galing?"

"Namyesta kami ni nanay sa kabilang bayan kuya! Sayang di kayo sumama ni ate--ang daming pagkain!"


Dama opened her eyes.

"Talaga? Nag-uwi kayo ng ulam?"

"Hindi lang ulam kuya! May dessert pa!" 

 

She heard Zelo laugh. Pero ewan ba nya... when she heard Meera's bubbly voice talking about left-over food, she felt something else. Parang nakaramdam sya ng awa... awa sa pamilya nina Zelo at sa lahat ng pamilya na kinakailangan pang mamyesta para makatikim ng masarap na karne.

She remembered those times na ipinapataon nya sa katulong ang pagkain kapag hindi nya nagustuhan ang luto. They were begging her back then na ipakain na lamang sa iba ang pagkain na yun but she insisted it be thrown on the garbage.

Hindi na nga naman ito mapapakinabangan pa kase nasa basurahan nya.

 

I'm that bad huh?

 

Biglang bumukas ang pintuan ng kwarto and in came Zelo.

"Tara kakain?"

Tinanguan nya ito. Inalok naman nito ang kamay nito sa kanya. Kinuha nya iyon and she was helped out the bed by him.

"Masakit pa ba?" He pointed at her hand. She nodded. 

Nagulat sya when he took her injured hand to his lips and kissed it.

"Sorry." He muttered after.

 

Hindi na sya nakapagsalita.

 

Hinila sya nito palabas ng kwarto. Binitawan din nito agad ang kamay niya ng makita sina Meera at Manang Pacing sa kusina na nag-aayos ng hapag kainan.

"Hindi pa kayo kumakain?" Tanong ng matanda sa kanila. Pareho silang umiling.

"Ay ate! Marami kaming dalang ulam!" Meera exclaimed. Nginitian nya ito at pinisil sa pisngi.

"Talaga?"

"Oo ate! May menudo... kaldereta... saka lechong kawali! Tapos pinabaunan pa kami ng ube halaya!"

"Wow." She made an impressed face. Ibinaling nya ang atensiyon sa hapag. True... marami ngang putahe. But compared to her lunch at the mansion... wala pa ito sa kalahati ng regular nilang handa sa mesa.

She sighed.

 

Might as well eat.

 

Naupo si Zelo sa tabi nya.

"Pakiabot--"

Hindi na nya natapos ang sasabihin ng ipaglagay sya nito ng kanin sa pinggan.

"Saka ano--"

Tapos nilagyan nito ng ulam iyon.

"Thanks." Nasabi na lang niya.

 

"Kuya may sakit ka ba? Bakit ang bait mo kay ate?" Takang-tanong ni Meera sa binata.

Napasinghap na naman siya ng biglang hawakan ng binata ang kamay niya... her injured hand. Ipinakita nito iyon sa mag-ina.

"Ano'ng nangyari?!" Manang Pacing looked horrified upon seeing her hand... na medyo may pasa-pasa na. Ni langaw nga bawal makalapit sa kanya tapos ngayon... nagkapasa pa?

"Kasalanan ko." Sagot ni Zelo.

"Ano ba yan anak? Di ba sabi ko babantayan mo itong si Dama? Mananagot tayo sa mag-asawa nyan eh..." Manang Pacing reprimanded.

"Okay lang po. It was partly my fault naman." Pagdedefend nya sa lalaki.

 

Napabuntong-hininga si Manang Pacing.

"Wag na kase kayong mag-away ha? Nagkakasakitan na kayo eh." Pakiusap nito sa kanila.

"Hindi na nga po." Pangako ni Zelo. She felt him squeeze her hand before he let it go. "Sorry." He said to her.

"Sorry din." She replied.

 

"Tss. Sorry sorry... tapos bukas away na naman?" Naiiling na puna ng bata.

"Haynako. Kumain ka na nga lang." Halos ay magkasabay nilang sabi. Natawa tuloy ang mag-ina.

"Mukhang nagkakadikit na ang bituka nyong dalawa ah?" Nakangiti nitong sabi.

Nagkatinginan silang dalawa ng binata... and then they both smiled to each other. 

 

They both bear a secret that no one else must know or else, they may be screwed.

 

Pero hanggang kailan?

 

xxxxx

AN: Sorry sa UD, I lost the motivation along the way. Hope it's fine. Medyo hindi sya nakakakilig but then again, I don't think I'm the expert at that. Pero sana magustuhan nyo pa rin. Ayun...

I swear, if I ever see another UD NA PO!! knowing all too well na kakapost ko pa lang, magko-quota ako sa comments and votes. Depende sa mood ko.

It will be ugly, I tell you. So... konsiderasyon lang naman po at konting patience ha?

Salamat.

Back to regular classes na.

Back to regular days.

Back to being cousins who are simply annoyed of being around each other.

 

Naupo si Zelo sa gilid ng papag at tinitigan ang dalaga. She was in a fetal position while hugging her pillow. Some said that this particular sleeping position signifies that the person is yearning for something. 

Love, maybe?

 

--

 

Ang saya-saya ni Dama... finally! She's getting married! 

"You may now kiss the bride." She heard the priest say.

Her beau held her hand at humarap ito sa kanya. She couldn't see his face clearly. All she knows is that she's so in love with him kahit pa nga naka-clown costume ito na black and white.

Suddenly, her gown changed into a cave woman's costume. She couldn't quite figure out why she would wear such a ridiculous outfit on her own wedding... but it seemed so right.

 

Her groom lifted up her veil. At saka nito pinisil ng todo ang pisngi nya.

"Gising na!"

Nagulat sya ng naging si Zelo ito na nakasando at shorts lang.

She was so upset that she wanted to slap him with the vase she was holding. It was supposed to be her bouquet but she wanted it on a vase.

"Gising na!"

 

Dama forced her eyes open. Nakita nya si Zelo na nakatungo sa kanya... still pinching her cheeks. Instantly, that grave feeling she felt on her dream turned into a happy feeling. She breathed out a sigh of relief ng marealize nya na hindi pa pala sya ikakasal... at sa ibang lalaki pa.

She was so happy that it's all a dream kaya niyakap nya agad si Zelo.

 

Natigilan ang binata.

 

"B-Bangon na." Sabi na lang nito sa kanya.

"Good morning." She murmured against his chest. He patted her head in reply.

"Tinanghali ka na naman."

"Sorry."

"Bitaw na. Baka makita tayo." Hinawakan ni Zelo ang brasong nakapulupot sa kanya at pilit iyong tinatanggal. Nasa labas lang ang nanay nya and he's scared for them to be found out.

"Saglit lang." Lalo namang humigpit ang yakap ng dalaga.

 

Makalipas ang limang minuto...

"Tulog ka na yata eh."

"Ang sarap kaseng yumakap sa 'yo." Sagot ng dalaga.

Zelo chuckled. "Adik. Bitaw na. Malilate tayo pareho eh."

 

Sumunod si Dama.

"Exams na natin bukas no?" Tanong nya sa binata. Tumango ito. "Nakapag-review ka na?"

"Di na kelangan."

Sinimangutan nya ito sa sagot nito. "Yabang."

"Ikaw, nag-aral ka na?" Tanong nito sa kanya.

Umiling sya. "Kokopya na lang ako sa 'yo bukas." Nakagiti niyang sagot.

 

Zelo scoffed. "Oy di porke't--" He blushed because he can't say the next words. Nahihiya pa rin kase sya. Dama understood--for she too is too shy to say it.

"Anak gising na ba?"  Narinig nilang tanong ni Manang Pacing mula sa labas.

"O-Opo!" Sagot ni Zelo sa ina.

"Hala labas na kayo at ng makakain. Mahuhuli na kayo eh."

"Andyan na po!" He looked at her. "Tara?"

Hinawakan sya nito sa kamay at hinila palabas ng kwarto. When they were out... agad itong bumitaw para hindi makita ng ina.

Bahagya syang nalungkot sa ginawa nito. She was just about to get all giddy inside tapos... wala na. Putol na agad.

Pero wala naman syang magagawa. Ganun talaga...

 

--

 

Dama crumpled the paper on her hand with fury. Kasalukuyan silang nagre-review ng barkada ng biglang mapadaan sa malapit nila sina Zelo at Tassie.

Magkahawak-kamay.

 

Little organ... why am I doing this?

 

Nakakalungkot lang. Yung kamay na kanina lang ay nakahawak sa kamay nya, sa kamay na ng iba nakahawak.

Yung kanina lang ay nakayakap sa kanya, ngayon nakaakbay na sa iba. Ang masaklap pa, sa girlfriend talaga nito... hindi katulad nya.

Ano nga ba naman sya dito?

Pinsan?


Minsan hindi nya maiwasang mag-isip kung totoo ba yung mg pinagsasabi nito sa kanya. But then again, they don't have a choice. He has to do it....

"Hoy Dama! Nakatanga ka na naman kung saan!" Bulyaw ni Lei sa kanya.

Inis siyang bumaling dito. "Ano ba! Sigaw ng sigaw!"

"Makinig ka kase!" Lei retorted.

"Tss. Oo na!"

She tried concentrating on their group review pero wala talagang pumapasok sa utak nya dahil occupied na ito ng isang tao.

She sighed, knowing all too well that she will never pass the exam tomorrow.

 

--





Kinagabihan...

"O ano? Kumusta review nyo kanina?" Tanong ni Zelo sa kanya. Kakatapos lang nilang kumain when Manang Pacing took over washing the dishes para makapag-aral silang dalawa.

Dama crinkled her nose. "Walang pumasok sa utak ko."

"Tsk. Ayusin mo. Midterm yun. Di ka pwedeng bumagsak." Paalala nito sa kanya.

"Oo alam ko." She gave him a smile. "Turuan mo 'ko?"

"Ano pa nga ba?"

 

So they studied. Well... she seemed to be so absorbed on him that she can't actually process what he's saying. Zelo's intelligent. Intelligent enough for her to learn anything that he's teaching him... if only she's listening.

"Mga anak... matutulog na ako ha?" Paalam ni Manang Pacing sa kanila ng bandang mga alas dyes na ng gabi.

"Sige nay, sa kwarto na lang po kayo matulog."

Nanlaki ang mata ni Dama sa sinabi ng binata.

"At ako? San ako tutulog?"

"Di ka matutulog hanggat hindi mo namememorize yan lahat." He pointed at the notes. 

Dama grunted. "But I can't do without sleep!"

"Eh di sagutan mo na yang pinapasagutan ko sa 'yo. Kapag naperfect mo yan, pwede ka ng matulog."

"Ang hirap-hirap kaya ng mga tanong mo!" Reklamo niya.

"Madali lang yan kung nakikinig ka sa lessons." 

 

Nailing na lamang ang matanda sa pagbabangayan ng dalawa.

 

Pagkapasok ni Manang Pacing, agad na tinanong ni Dama si Zelo.

"Seryoso? Hindi talaga ako pwedeng matulog?"

"Hindi nga."

"Eeee... mapupuyat ako!" Ungot niya sa binata.

"Natural lang yan sa estudyante." Pagdadahilan naman ng binata.

She grunted again. Then sighed...

"Alam mo ba kung bakit hindi ako maka-concentrate kanina?" Mahina nyang tanong.

Tumango ang binata.

"Sorry... kailangan eh. Hayaan mo... babawi ako sa 'yo." Pagkasabi'y ngumiti ito sa kanya. "May premyo ka sa 'kin kapag nasagot mo yan lahat ng tama."

"Premyo? Ano'ng premyo naman?" Tanong niya rito.

"Basta." Nakangiti pa rin nitong sagot.

 

Dama decided that whatever it is... sisikapin nya iyong makuha. Galing kay Zelo eh...

 

--

 

Time check: 1:08am...

Bangag na si Dama but there are still 5 more questions to be answered. Hanep lang kaseng mag-prepare ng questionnaires si Zelo... talagang paduguan ng ilong ang pagsagot.

Mahigit 200 questions ata ang kailangan nyang sagutan. Four subjects yun na halo-halo. Naloloka na nga sya. Karamihan pa sa mga tanong ay yun talagang hindi nya pinagtuunan ng pansin during discussions.

 

She almost cheered out loud ng masagutan nya ang pinakahuling tanong. Agad nya iyong ibinigay sa binata para i-check nito.

Dama got fascinated with him. Mukha kase itong articulate and super serious which she found really cute of him. Masyado naman itong napapakunot sa mga sagot nya.

Then he did it.... the first big X.




Na nasundan pa ng marami. She sighed...

Goodbye premyo.

 

Pero at least naman may tumamang sagot.

"At this rate, di ka talaga papasa bukas." Naiiling nitong sabi pagkatapos nitong i-check yung mga sagot nya.

Napasimangot sya. "Ganyan ba kahihirap ang mga tanong?"

He shrugged. "Ewan. Tulog na tayo?" Nagsimula itong mag-impis ng mga nakakalat na notebook sa nakalatag na banig. Ang pang-mahirap na coffee table ay nasa gilid to give way sa pang-mahirap na panlatag na syang hinihigaan ng mag-ina sa tuwing matutulog.

"Dito ka na lang." Tumayo si Zelo at ipinaglagay sya ng tatlong unan sa banig. Nagtira lamang ito ng isa para sa sarili.

"Di ba pwedeng dito ka na lang? Ang lawak-lawak oh." She pointed out.

Ginulo nito ang buhok nya. "Di pwede. Magagalit si nanay."

 

Dama pouted. 

"Good night." 

Nahiga sya at saka binalot ng manipis na kumot ang sarili.

 

"Teka... bangon ka muna." Sabi ni Zelo.

She sat up. "Bakit?"

 

Instead of answering, kinabig ni Zelo ang dalaga and gave her a peck.. on the lips.

"Para sa effort mo." Nahihiya nitong sabi. "Good night."

Agad ay nahiga ito sa mahabang upuan at tumalikod sa kanya.

 

Tinakpan ni Dama ang bibig to stop her squeal. Sobrang lapad ng ngiti nya. Ayaw ng matanggal!

Little orgaaaaaan! For God's sake, stop palpitating! Oo na! Alam kong nakakakilig pero baka naman hindi ako makatulog sa ingay mo.

She couldn't stop smiling. Nakahiga na sya't lahat... at tumalikod pa nga sa binata pero hindi talaga mawala-wala ang ngiti nya.

 

He kissed me! Ohmygosh... I wanna die! But not now... Hahaha! Ang gulo ko!

 

That night, she slept with the most genuine and happy smile plastered on her face.

xxxxx

Hindi na ako hihingi ng pasensya kung matagal ang UD kase oras ko naman ang sinasayang ko sa paggagawa ng kwentong 'to.

Ayun... sa mga hihingi agad ng UD... pakisapak na lang ang sarili nyo ha? ^^

COMMENT!--yung may kwenta. Salamat.

The exam was a lot EASIER than the practice questions Zelo had prepared for Dama. Multiple choice ang first part. Then identification naman sa part 2. Tapos essay.

 

Easy as pie, she thought.

 

She stole a glance at her friends. Kanina pa kamot ng kamot sa ulo si Eli na nanghahaba na ang nguso sa sobrang pagka-confused. Si Lei naman ay seryosong-seryoso.

Hindi nya makita yung tatlo pa dahil nasa likura sila. She can't turn her head with the teacher around. Naiinis tuloy sya. Hindi sya makakuha ng inspirasyon eh. Nasa pinakang-likod kase si Zelo.

She remembered their conversation earlier. Sadya yun eh.

"Tabi tayo ha? Patulad ako." She suggested.

"Ayoko nga. Para san pa yung pinag-aralan mo kung mangongopya ka lang din?" Sagot nito.

"Eh... para sure!"

He pinched her cheek. "Di pwede. Sa pinakang-unahan ka mauupo. Ako sa pinakang-likod."

"Eeeeeh! Anlayo naman!" Reklamo niya.

"Ganun talaga."

"May premyo ba ulit kapag nakapasa ako?"

Nginitian sya ng binata. "Tingnan natin."




She sighed. Makakapasa kaya siya? Sure, she could answer all the questions... wala nga lang guarantee kung tama lahat.

But then again... the things she'd do for a kiss....

 

Napangiti sya.

AJA little heart! Makakapasa ako! Para sa kiss!

 

--

 

Dani came home a bit late so he was really hungry. He was so tired from all the work that he almost slumped at the couch and slept there... kung hindi lang talaga nya napansing hindi na naman sya sinalubong ng asawa.

"Manang, si mommy asan?" Tanong nya sa katulong na kumuha ng gamit nya. 

"Nasa kusina sir." Sagot nito.

"Kumakain?"

"Nagluluto po."

"Ah..."

 

Tumayo siya at naglakad papuntang kusina. He saw her standing near the stove. Her hair was tied into a bun at naka-apron ito.

Nilapitan nya ito at niyakap mula sa likuran. "Hi." He greeted.

"Hello. Bakit late ka?"

"Ang daming trabaho eh. What are you cooking?"

"Bicol express." She replied with a smile.

"Wow... tamang-tama, gutom na 'ko." After saying that, he buried his face on her neck and nibbled at it. She smelled so good... amoy-ulam.

"Daddy, I'm all sweaty." Mahinang reklamo ni Meg.

He kissed her on the cheek then at her temple. "Ang bango mo ma. Kanin na lang ang kulang."

She laughed. "Adik."

"How's our baby?" He asked.

"She's fine."

"She?" He inquired.

"I think it's a she. Sabi kase nila manang, lalo daw nakakaganda sa mommy kapag babae ang baby."

Dani laughed. "How will we know then? Palagi ka namang maganda."

Meg smiled at him ang pulled his head for a quick kiss. "Bolero."

"Di kaya." He assured her.

 

She kissed him again. This time, their lips lingered. Iniharap nya ang asawa sa kanya at kinawit nya ito sa bewang. Ikinawit naman ni Megan ang braso nito sa kanya. They kissed some more... like they could not get enough.

Nasa ganoon silang estado ng madatnan sila ni Aling Rosa, yung dating mag-aalaga nina Dani at Angel na ngayon ay mayor doma na sa bahay.

Tumikhim ang matanda.

 

Hindi naman nila narinig.

 

"Ay ano ba yan! Kaya naman pala nilalanggam palagi sa kusina!" Reklamo nito. 

Meg pulled away upon hearing the old woman's voice.

"Hi manang." Nakangiting bati ni Dani sa matanda.

"Good evening manang." Bati naman ni Meg dito.

Umirap ang matanda. "Susme... mga kabataan nga naman ngayon... kung saan saan naglalampungan!"

Tumawa ang mag-asawa at nilapitan ang matanda.

"Hug ka namin manang."

"Ikaw kase, sagutin mo na si lolo sa kanto ng may kalampungan ka na rin." 

Niyakap nilang pareho ang matanda.

"Ano ba! Ang init-init eh!" Reklamo nito.

Pinakawalan nila ang matandang palaging high blood. Mainitin talaga ang ulo nito kahit noon pa. Pero hindi naman masama ang ugali nito. Sadyang masungit lang dahil hindi nakapag-asawa.

Lumabas ito ng kusina ng nagngunguyngoy. Nagkangitian na lang ang mag-asawa.

 

"Hindi pa ba maluluto yan ma?" Dani pointed at what's cooking on the stove.

"Konti na lang dad. Come, taste it." Hinila sya ng asawa palapit sa niluluto nito. Saka sya kumuha ng konting sabaw gamit ang isang kutsara. She put it in his mouth.

 

His face instantly became red.

"Dad, are you okay?"

"T-Tubig!"

Agad na kumuha ng gatas sa ref si Meg. "You can't drink water. Lalo lang yang aanghang. Here... drink this." Iniabot nito ang isang baso ng gatas sa kanya.

Agad nyang ininom iyon.

"What was that?!"

"What? May kulang ba?"

Dani bit the back of his hand. His mouth was still stinging from that one spoon of hell.

"How much spice did you put on the dish?" He asked her.

"Well... I blended the chilies to get that full spice. Natatabangan kase ako sa luto nila ng Bicol Express eh." Paliwanag nito sa kanya.

"How much?" Pag-uulit niya.

"About half the content of that basket." Meg pointed at the basket that was on the granite isle. Halos 5 inches ito in diameter at 3 inches in height. Nakita ni Dani na halos kakarampot na lang ang natitirang laman noon.

He sighed. "Ma... are you trying to kill me?"

Natawa naman ang asawa sa tanong nya. "Of coure not silly! Eh di nawalan ako ng asawa!"

"Eh bakit sobrang anghang nyan? Walang kakain nyan ma..."

Meg pouted. "Kahit ikaw?"

"I can't eat that. Eto nga't parang nawalan na 'ko ng ganang kumain."

 

Sumubsob ang asawa sa dibdib niya. Then he heard her say, "She will eat that."

Niyakap nya ito. "Maybe... bawasan lang ng konting anghang and she'll definitely eat that. Lalo na't luto mo."

He remembered how Dama loves her mother's cooking. Kahit pa nga nung mga panahon na sobrang weirdo nito pagdating sa pagkain dahil buntis... ang panganay nila ang matyagang kumakain ng mga niluluto nito.

Lalo na kung spicy food. Mahilig kase sa maanghang ang dalaga.

"You want to bring her some?" Alok niya sa asawa.

"I... I can't dad. You know how much she hates me." Malungkot nitong sagot.

"She doesn't hate you."

"I can't. I can't see her. Hindi pa tamang panahon."

 

"Well then, can I bring her some?"

Umiling ito. "She can't see you either. Let's give her more time dad..."

He kissed her forehead. "I hate seeing you sad ma."

"Sorry daddy." Pinilit nitong ngumiti. "Wait up. I'll just finish up the dish and then I'll pack some for her."

"Okay. Uh--wala na bang ibang pagkain dyan?"

"Meron. May kaldereta at morcon sa ref. Ipag-init kita?"

"Ako na ma. Tapusin mo na yan."

"Okay." She replied.

 

--

 

"I don't like this." Reklamo ni Dama sa mag-iina na nasa harap ng hapag kainan. Itlog na pula na may kamatis kase ang ulam nila. Eh hindi sya nakain nun.

"Di 'wag kang kumain." Sagot naman ni Zelo. She gave him a glare.

"Ansama mo." Nakanguso nyang sabi.

"Ang arte mo naman." He retorted.

 

"Hindi na daw mag-aaway o." Puna ng batang si Meera.

"Anak, ibili mo ng ulam sa kanto si Dama. Dali na."

Napabuntong-hininga ang binata. Napilitan itong tumayo at abutin ang 40 pesos na iniaabot ng ina.

"Last mo na 'to ha." Sabi nito sa kanya. She just smiled at him. Nakautak na naman sya.

 

Lumabas si Zelo ng bahay. Tapos maya-maya, pumasok ulit ito... may dalang isang malaking tupperware.

"Ang bilis mo naman!"

"Ano yan anak?"

Ipinatong ni Zelo ang hawak sa lamesa. "Padala ng mommy mo." Sabi nito kay Dama.

"Si mommy? Weh?" Hindi makapaniwala nyang tanong.

"Oo nga."

"Ano kaya 'to?" She lifted the lid. "Waaaah! My favorite!" Agad syang kumuha ng kutsara at isinawsaw iyon sa ulam. Tinikman nya iyon and she was even more glad dahil sobrang anghang nito. She was about to dip the spoon again when Zelo stopped her.

"Mapapanis yan kapag isang kutsara lang ang ginamit mo. Sayang naman." Kumuha ito ng sandok. "Ayan. Yan ang gamitin mo."

"Thank you!" Tuwa nyang sabi dito.

Masaya syang kumain ng gabing yun. Ewan ba nya, iba pa rin kase yung feeling na ang pagkain mo ay yung luto mismo ng magulang mo... 

"Mamahingi ka naman." Reklamo ni Zelo.

She gladly gave him the food. Pati sina Manang Pacing at Meera ay kumuha pero tinigilan nila matapos lang ang ilang subo.

Sobrang anghang kase kaya sila lang ni Zelo ang nakatagal kumain.

 

They were in the midst of eating their meals ng biglang mag-ring ang phone nya. Agad siyang tumakbo sa kwarto at kinuha ang cellphone.

 

Dad calling...

 

She answered it.

"Hey dad!"

"Hey sweetie. Did you like the food?"

"Yeah. Thanks dad! Ang sarap ng luto mo, as always."

She heard him chuckle on the other end. "I didn't cook it... but I'm sure your mom would be happy you liked it."

Napataas ang kilay niya sa narinig. "She made it?"

"Uh-huh. And I think she'd appreciate it if you'd thank her for it."

"I don't know dad." Nag-aalangan nyang sagot.

"Come on sweetie... oh--here she comes!" 




Napalunok ang dalaga.

"Hello?"

"Hi."

 

Awkward silence followed.

 

"Uh... so... thanks for... the food."

 

More silence.

 

"Did you like it?"

 

 "Uh--yeah."

 

She can't be sure but she thought she heard her mom gave out a sigh of relief.

 

"Dad eto na oh." 

"Did she talk to you?"

"Yeah dad."




"Hello?"

"Yes dad?"

"How are you?"

"Okay naman po. Kakatapos lang ng exams."

"Oh? Nakasagot ka naman?"

"Syempre dad! Ako pa!"

 

Her father laughed.

"Sige dad. Kumakain pa kami eh. Have you eaten?"

"Yeah. Bakit late kayong kumain?"

"Wala lang. Nalate kase kami ng pagluluto eh. I'll go ahead dad. Love you!"

"I love you too sweetie. Eh how about mommy?"

 

She rolled her eyes. Daddy nya talaga... gagawin ang lahat mapag-ayos lang sila ng mommy nya.

"Tell her I love her too."

 

"I love you too sweetie. Goodnight."

 

Tut. Tut. Tut.

 

Her heart skidded ng marinig nya ang boses ng ina. Ang adik lang talaga ng daddy nya. Ngayon, hindi na tuloy nya alam kung paano sya makikiharap muli sa ina.

She stopped saying I love you to her when she was ten. Or was it 8?

Basta... hindi na nya matandaan kung kelan syang huling nagsabi noon dito.

 

I love you too sweetie.

 

She smiled as she remembered her mom's response.

 

Things are getting better little heart... sana tuloy-tuloy na.

 You're like a zombie; no matter how many brains you eat... you'll never have one. Keep on trying though.

A week later...

"Ang saya mo ah..." Puna ni Zelo sa dalaga na umagang-umaga pa lang ay pagkalaki-laki na ng ngiti at mukhang ang sigla-sigla.

"Syempre." Sagot niya sa binata.

Paanong hindi sya sasaya eh araw-araw syang pinapadalhan ng mommy nya ng kung anu-anong pagkain? Napansin rin nyang dinadagdagan nito ang allowance niya ng paunti-unti... basta palagi syang mag-a-I love you dito.

Her smile widened.

Ngayon alam nya na ang weakness ng ina.

 

"Checking na ng papers mamaya." Sabi ni Zelo.

"Oo nga eh. Ready your prize ha?" Nakangiti nyang sagot dito.

He smiled back. "Sure."

"Yo!" Pinagitnaan sila ni Eli at umakbay ito sa kanilang dalawa.

"Morning." Nakangiting bati ng dalaga dito.

Mukhang nagulat si Eli.

"Whoa... ang ganda mo pala no?"

Bahagyang natawa si Zelo. Sinapok naman niya si Eli.

"Ang sama mo! Ngayon mo lang napansin?" Mataray nyang tanong dito.

"Di naman kase kapansin-pansin eh." Natatawa nitong biro sa kanya.

Tuluyan ng natawa si Zelo.

 

She glared at him. "Isa ka pa!"

 

Tumigil ito sa pagtawa. "Galit ka na naman?"

"Eh kayo kase!" Reklamo ng dalaga.

"Joke lang yun. Di ka naman mabiro." Paliwanag ni Eli.

 

Pinalis niya ang kamay ng binata mula sa balikat niya at umuna sya sa paglalakad. Naiiling na lang na sumunod ang dalawang lalaki sa kanya.

 

--

 

School... after checking...

Masayang lumapit ang dalaga kay Zelo after nilang ma-check lahat ng exam papers that day. She showed him her papers.

"I passed them all." She said to him.

"Kita ko nga."

"Yung premyo ko ha?"

"Tss. Excited? Mamaya pag-uwi."

 

Little heart, sana mag-uwian na!

 

--

 

Lunch time. As usual, nahila na naman ni Tassie ang boyfriend nito palayo sa barkada... at palayo kay Dama. Nawalan tuloy ng ganang kumain ang dalaga kahit ba ang sarap-sarap tingnan ng mga pagkain na nakahain sa mesa nila.

"Uy best... kain ka na." Untag ni Eula sa kanya.

"Ano na namang problema nito?" Tanong ni Lei.

"Oy umamin ka nga... nagsi-selos ka ba kay Tassie?"

 

Biglang kumabog ang dibdib nya sa kaba. Buong akala nya ay walang nakakapansin na sa tuwing dumarating si Tassie para kunin si Zelo ay biglang nag-iiba ang mood nya.

Sumasama lalo.

 

Ganun na ba sya ka-obvious?

 

"Attention-seeker kase yang masyado." Puna ni Eli.

"Oo nga." Pagsang-ayon naman ni Keeme.

"Wag kang mag-alala best, kapag nagka-boyfriend ka na din, malelessen na rin yung atensyon mo kay Zelo."

"Tama tama. Mag-boyfriend ka na kase ng hindi ka magmukhang kawawa." Dagdag ni Lei.

 

Sinimangutan nya ang mga kaibigan. She was relieved though...

 

"Ang sasama nyo." Tinawanan lang sya ng mga ito.

 

"Ah miss.. excuse me." Tiningala nya ang kumuhit sa balikat nya. Schoolmate nila ang lalaki based on his school uniform. May hawak itong isang platito ng minatamisang saba.

"Yes?" She inquired.

"May nagpapabigay sa 'yo nito oh." Ipinatong nito yung platito sa mesa. 

"Ayeeeeeee...." Loko sa kanya ng mga loko nyang kaibigan.

Hindi nya pinansin ang mga ito.

 

"Kanino galing?" Tanong nya sa lalaki.

 

"Dun oh. Kay Pierre." Itinuro nito ang isang lalaki mula sa table na malapit sa pintuan ng kubo. 

 

Pierre? Why does that name sounds do familiar?





Tiningnan nya yung Pierre. When he saw na nakatingin sya, kumaway ito sa kanya. Agad syang bumaling muli sa mga kaibigan.

"Uyyyyy... in fairness ha... gwapo!"

She ignored Eula's remark saka sya muling bumaling sa lalaking nagdala ng pagkain. "Tell him I said thanks."

Nginitian sya nito. "Ah miss... pati ano daw... pwede daw bang malaman ang pangalan mo?"

"Dama ang pangalan nya!" Si Lei ang sumagot.

"Single din sya at the moment!" Dagdag ni Eula.

"At naghahanap ng boyfriend." Natatawang dagdag ni Eli.

"Hoy! Magsitigil nga kayo!" Saway nya sa mga ito.

 

Nagtawanan lang ang mga ito.

"Sige sige. Makakarating." Sabi ng lalaki. Agad itong tumakbo pabalik sa table nito. Sinundan nya iyon ng tingin. Nakita niyang may sinabi ito kay Pierre tapos all his friends hooted. Napangiti naman ito at napatingin sa kanya.

He smiled at her when he saw her looking.

 

Agad naman syang bumaling muli sa mga kaibigan na mukhang tanga dahil sa sobrang lapad ng mga ngiti sa mukha.

She rolled her eyes then pushed the plate away.

"Kainin nyo na." Sabi nya sa mga ito.

"Ha? Bat kami eh sayo yan binigay?"

She crinkled her nose. "Mamaya may gayuma pa yan." Sagot nya.

"Ano ka ba best! Yung ganun kagwapo tingin mo kakailanganin pa ng gayuma para mapasagot ka?"

"Tingin nyo sa'kin? Porket gwapo, papatulan ko na agad?"

"Oo." Nakangiting sagot ni Eula.

"Walanghiya ka." Sabi nya sabay hampas dito.

 

--

 

Pagkabalik sa klase, medyo pre-occupied si Dama. Naaalala nya kase yung nangyari kanina. First time kase syang tudyuin. Kase sino ba namang makakapanukso sa kanya dati eh wala naman syang kaibigan? Ngali-ngali tuloy nyang dumaan sa backdoor ng kubo kaso hinawakan sya nina Lei at Eula sa tigkabila nyang braso.

So she was forced to walk through the front door.

At talagang hindi umalis yung grupo nina Pierre hanggat hindi sila nakakadaan.

Tinutukso naman ito ng sariling grupo nito. Bahagya silang nagkatinginan. Unable to say anything, ngumiti na lang ito sa kanya. She shyly looked away saka niya binilisan ang lakad.

 

"Yeeee best... iniisip mo pa rin si Pierre no?" Untag ni Eula sa kanya.

"Sino'ng Pierre?" Kunot-noong tanong ni Zelo.

Napatingin sya dito. He was looking at Eula, waiting for an answer. Parang gusto nyang takpan ang bibig ng kaibigan para hindi nito masabi.

Ewan nya... natatakot kase sya sa magiging reaction nito...

"Yung may crush sa kanya!" Eula said with a giggle.

"Ah..." Sabi lang nito saka ito bumalik sa upuan.

 

....or lack thereof

 

--

 

Uwian na. Pero ewan ba nya. Parang nawalan sya ng gana. Pano kase, she couldn't erase his reaction off her mind. Yun na yun? She was kinda expecting more.

Hindi man lang ito nagselos.

 

"Bilisan mo ngang maglakad!" Biglang bulyaw nito na ikinagulat niya. She quickened her pace para makasabay dito but he was still two steps ahead every time.

Nang makarating sila sa bahay ay agad itong nagbihis at saka nagdikit ng apoy. Mukhang wala si Manang Pacing. Baka sinusundo nito si Meera sa kung saan. Gala kase ang batang yun kaya kung saan saan nakakarating.

 

She tried helping him sa pamamagitan ng paglilinis ng kalderong pagsasaingan pero inagaw nito iyon sa kanya at ito na mismo ang naglinis.

"Galit ka ba?" Tanong nya rito.

"Hindi." He replied coldly.

"Eh bakit ganyan ka?"

"Ganito talaga 'ko."

 

Silence.

 

Pagkahugas ng bigas ay isinalang na ni Zelo ang kaldero sa kalan. Tapos ay lumabas ito para bumili ng maluluto. Pagkabalik ay may dala itong isda at gulay at mukhang magsisigang.

"Can I help?" She asked. 

Hindi sya pinansin nito na talaga namang ikinainis nya.

 

Hindi raw galit. Tss.

 

"Uy... mamansin ka naman." Untag nya rito.

Patuloy lang ito sa pagkakaliskis ng isda na talagang ipinagtatalsikan nito yung kaliskis sa kanya ng lumayo sya.

But she persisted.

"Zelo..." Ungot nya. "Bakit ka ba kase nagagalit sa 'kin? Ano na namang ginawa ko?"

Napabuntong-hininga ang binata.

 

"Sino si Pierre?" Maya-maya'y tanong nito.

"Ano... wala lang yun."

"Sigurado ka ha?"

"Oo nga. Bakit b--teka nga... nagseselos ka ba?" Bigla syang napangiti. She never thought na magseselos ito. Tuwang-tuwa tuloy sya sa reaction nito ngayon.

 

He gave her a dead look.

 

Lalong lumapad ang ngiti nya. "Nagseselos ka no?" Tudyo niya rito.

Hindi ito sumagot pero masama pa rin ang tingin sa kanya.

"Ano ka ba! Wala lang yun!" She assured him.

"Eh bakit tuwang-tuwa ka dyan?"

"Eh nagseselos ka kase!' Natatawa nyang sabi.

 

"Tss." Hinugasan nito ang mga isda saka hinati sa tatlo.

 

"Asan na yung premyo ko?" She inquired.

"Wala."

She pouted. "Andaya! You promised!" Reklamo niya.

"Next time na lang."

"Eeee... nakakainis ka!"

Hinampas-hampas nya ang braso nito.

 

"I hate you!"

He sighed.

"Naghirap pa naman ako sa pagsasagot ng exams tapos wala lang pala?" Dagdag pa niya.

 

Bigla itong yumuko at mabilis syang hinalikan sa labi. Sa sobrang bilis... hindi nya halos naramdaman... although she have to admit na nagsasayaw na naman ang malalandi nyang nerve cells.

"Yun lang?" Disappointed nyang tanong.

Napabuntong-hininga na naman ito at tiningnan sya.

"Ano na namang gusto mo?" Tanong nito sa kanya.

"Gusto ko matagal!" She demanded.

 

Akala nya ay hindi sya pagbibigyan nito at sasabihang nag-iinarte na naman sya. She was actually so surprised ng halikan sya nitong muli. No hands. Just his lips on hers dahil malansa ang kamay nito.

The kiss lingered and it brought her a whole new different level of sensation.

Now, she could properly feel his lips... na ang lambot-lambot.

 

Ayaw na nyang humiwalay...

 

It's their first real kiss.

Her first real kiss...

 

"Sabi ko naman sayong wag kang maglalaro sa tabing ilog di ba? Tingnan mo tuloy ang damit mo! Ang dumi-dumi!"

"Sorry na po. Nadulas po kase ako eh!"

"Kuu--ay kung hindi ka ba naman kase pumupunta doon ay di hindi ka sana dumumi ng ganyan!"





Naghiwalay silang dalawa ng marinig ang boses ng mag-ina.

 

Zelo went back to what he's doing. Nakita nyang namumula ang pinsgi nito. He looked so cute. Gusto nya tuloy halikan ulit ito.

Which she did. She gave him a peck on the cheek.

 

Lalo itong namula.

 

Niyakap niya ito mula sa likod.

"Thank you." She whispered. Saka sya nagtatakbo papunta sa kwarto bago pa man makapasok ang mag-ina sa bahay.

I don't have an attitude problem. You have a problem with my attitude.




--





Ganito pala ang feeling ng in love little heart?





Dama never knew that THAT thing can be so... exhilerating. Yung mga panakaw na tingin... yung mga pigil na ngiti... just knowing that the person you love loves you back... it was so... she can't put in into words.

Words aren't enough.

 

Ngayon nga, gusto nyang hawakan ang kamay ng binata while they were walking to school. Gusto nyang makaranas ng ganun--holding hands while walking. As if you were telling the world to back off because he's yours and you are his... exclusively.

But sadly she can't do that. No. Not with Eli around. Not with all the people who'd stare with disgust if she does.

Sadly... they have to suppress their feelings until they are alone. Because only when they're alone can they express how they really feel for each other.

Honesty in the dark...

 

Nasa may school gate na sila ng makita ni Dama ang isang pamilyar na mukha.

"Uy si Pierre!" Itinuro ni Eli ang lalaking nakasandal sa tabi ng gate. He was garnering too much attention. Medyo naka-clog yung gate dahil binabagalan ng mga babaeng maglakad para matitigan lang ang binata.

Tumigil sa paglalakad si Zelo at sinukat ng tingin ang lalaki.

 

Napatigil din sya. She glanced at Zelo and saw that his expression was the same as usual. And yet.... there's something. Something that's new.

It's a combination of utmost jealousy... and fear.

She doesn't understand why she's feeling it but she feels like he's afraid. Of what, she doesn't know.

 

Nang tumigil sila sa paglalakad, si Pierre na mismo ang lumapit sa kanila. But he couldn't get close enough... because Zelo won't let him.

"Sino 'to?" Tanong ni Pierre sa kanya.

"S-Si--"

"Pinsan nya. Si Zelo." Si Eli ang sumagot para sa dalawa.

"Ah... hi po." Nginitian nito si Zelo. Inaantay ng dalagang mag-react ang pinsan pero nakatingin lang ito kay Pierre at hindi nagsasalita.

"Hindi ba nagsasalita 'tong pinsan mo?" 

 

Biglang natawa si Eli at tinapik si Zelo sa balikat.

"Uy pre, magsalita ka kase."

Tiningnan ni Zelo ng masama si Eli saka bumaling muli kay Pierre. "Ano'ng kelangan mo sa pinsan ko?"

"Magha-hi lang. Masama?" Nakangiti nitong tanong.

"Tsk." Inirapan ni Zelo ang lalaki at saka hinila si Dama sa tabi nya. "O ayan. Mag-hi ka na. Bilis." Utos nito kay Pierre.

Nailing ng bahagya si Pierre saka tumawa ng mahina.

"Hi." He greeted her.

 

"H-Hello." 

 

"Oh ayan. Nagpalitan na kayo ng hi and hello. Una na kami." Pagkasabi'y agad sya nitong hinila papasok ng school. Eli trailed behind them habang taka na lang sila sinundan ng tingin ni Pierre.

Dama can't really think straight.

 

He was jealous! And he's holding my hand in public for crying out loud!




"U-Uy teka..." She pulled at him para patigilin ito sa paglalad. Pinagtitinginan na sila ng mga tao. For those who don't know na mag-pinsan sila, syempre iba ang iisipin nila. And what will they think of them? Madalas makita ng mga itong magkasama si Zelo at Tassie.

Baka kung anong kumalat na tsismis sa school.

She can't bear to be the cause of that.

"Ano ba pinsan! Masyado ka namang protective! Nagha-hi lang naman yung tao eh!" Ipinaglakasan nya ang boses to make sure na maririnig sya ng mga taong nakapaligid.

Mukhang nagulat ito sa ginawa nya.

 

Sakyan mo na lang please!

 

Napatingin ito sa kamay nila. And then he suddenly realized na nasa gitna nga pala sila ng pathway at gumagawa ng eksena.

Slowly, he let her hand go. "Sorry." He muttered saka ito umunang maglakad.

"Ang sungit ng pinsan mo ah." She heard Pierre say. Nilingon nya ito. Nakasunod na pala ito sa kanya.

She forced a smile. "Ganun talaga yun. Over-protective." Dahilan na lamang niya.

"So anyway, HI ulit. Ako nga pala si Pierre." He held out his hand.

 

She accepted it with hesitation. Nakarinig sya ng collective gasp from the crowd when he brought her hand to his lips and kissed it.

Agad yang namula. Saka madalian nyang binawi ang kamay mula sa lalaki.

"I-I have to go. Nice meeting you." She said saka sya lakad-takbong lumayo sa lalaki. She almost stopped on track when she saw Zelo sa bandang dulo ng pathway. It's pretty apparent that he saw all of it... tiim-bagang ito at ang sama-sama ng tingin.

She felt her knees weaken. She's trembling na pala dahil sa takot. Ewan nya... pero natatakot sya sa reaction ni Zelo. But she had no choice but to ignore it. To ignore him. To ignore her feelings...

Now is not the right time for feelings. And maybe there won't be a right time.

 

She sighed to let go of her anxiety ng madaanan nya ito.

 

--

 

During the afternoon, maaga silang pinauwi ng prof nila dahil may thesis defense ang fourth year. Isa ito sa mga panel. So ang barkada, tambay-tambay muna sa manggahan... para kay Eula.

Ipapanlaban kase ang volley ball team ng school nila sa SCUAA at kasama sa panlaban si number 5--who, come to think of it--ay hindi pa rin nya alam ang pangalan hanggang sa ngayon.

Nakakalimutan nya kaseng itanong sa kaibigan. Arellano lang ang alam nya dahil nakalagay sa sando nito.

"Kelan kaya sila magbi-break ng girlfriend nya?" Eula sighed.

"Wag ka ng umasa Yolanda." Pambabara ni Lei sa kapatid. Sinimangutan ito ni Eula.

"Nakakainis ka ate."

"Totoo naman eh. Ang hilig mong umasa sa wala."

"Tss. Porket binalikan ka ng ex mo ganyan ka ng magsalita?" Eula retorted.

"Psst oy. Tama na yan." Saway ni Eli sa magkapatid.

Bigla namang tumayo si Keeme at naglakad palayo.

"Oy san ang punta?" Tanong ni Dama dito.

"Sa labas. Magyoyosi." Sagot nito.

Tumayo din si Lei at sumunod sa kaibigan. 

"Magyoyosi ka rin Lei?" Taas-kilay nyang tanong dito.

"Tanga hindi. Susundan ko lang yun. Hindi yun nagyoyosi ng walang problema eh." 

 

Naiwan silang tatlo na nakaupo sa ilalim ng punong mangga. Si Zelo? Ayun... at his usual place--sa tabi ni Tassie. 

"Ang tanga ni ate no?" Sabi ni Eula sa dalawa.

"Bakit naman?" Tanong niya rito.

"Mukha kaseng balak nyang sagutin ulit yung ex nya." Sagot nito.

"Oh? Ano'ng masama dun?"

Sumimangot si Eula. "Eeee... mas gusto ko si Keeme para sa kanya. He's real. Kahit ganyan yan. Kahit basag-ulero. Maaasahan mo naman yan."

"Saka kahit madalas silang mag-away, mahal na mahal pa rin nya si Lei no?" Sabi naman ni Eli.

Nanlaki ang mata niya sa narinig.

Tumango si Eula. "Nakakainis kase yun. Di pa sabihin kay ate! Mauunahan na naman sya eh."

"Teka--teka nga!" Nawiwndang nyang sabi. "Gusto ni Keeme si Lei?"

Eli and Eula both nodded.

"Kelan pa?"

"Uh--second year yata? Or first year second sem? Basta matagal na eh."

"At ako lang ang walang alam?!"

"Di ka naman kase nagtatanong." Eli replied.

 

"Ang daya naman."

Who'd have thought? Daig pa ang aso't pusa kung mag-away ang dalawang yun. At hindi lang verbal fight. Nagsasakitan din sila physically. Well, more often than not, si Lei ang nananakit. Si Keeme hanggang bulyaw lang eh.

Kaya naman pala. He can't hurt her. Of course not. How can he if he's in love with her?

"Ouch!" Natigilan sa pagmumuni-muni si Dama ng marinig ang sigaw ng kaibigan. Tinamaan kase ito sa tiyan ng bola.

"Miss sorry!" Nakita nyang tumakbo palapit sa kanila ang isang matangkad na lalaki. Si number 24.

"Ano ba James! Ayusin mo nga! Nakakasakit ka eh!" Si number 5--galit.

"Sorry." James said to him. Saka ito tumingin muli kay Eula. "Miss, gusto mong dalhin kita sa clinic?"

Eula shook her head grimly. 

"Sure ka?"

"Oo kuya. Okay lang ako."

"Ganun ba?" Dumukot ito sa bulsa at naglabas ng isang Hershey's Treats na kulay red. "Eto oh... sa'yo na lang."

Eula smiled at him saka nito kinuha ang tsokolate. "Thank you."

Ngumiti na lang si number 24 saka bumalik sa court.

 

"Uy Eula... nagalit si number 5 mo. Pansin mo?" Panunudyo ni Dama sa kaibigan.

Eula sighed. "Di yun nagalit. Sadyang mainit lang ang ulo nun. Nag-away kase sila ng girlfriend nya kanina."

"Eh? Oh eh di masaya!" Nakangiti nyang sabi dito.

"Puro away lang. Di naman nagbi-break. San ba gawa ang relationship nila? Sa aspalto? Ang hirap tibagin eh!" Reklamo nito sa kanya.

"Wag kaseng umasa sa wala." Sabi ni Eli sa kaibigan.

"Heh! Isa ka pa!"

"Baka naman may HD ka  kay Eula, Eli?" Tanong niya rito.

Todo iling ang binata. "Uy di ah! Wala akong panahon sa love love na yan. Inosente pa 'ko."

"Inosente your face. Nabasted ka lang ng isang beses hindi ka na nanligaw ulit? Duwag!" Eula said.

"Aww... nabasted ang bata?" 

"Bakit ba sa 'kin napunta ang istorya? Nakakainis! Ito kaseng si Eula!"

"Aba ikaw kaya ang pasimuno!"

"Magsitigil nga kayo. Para kayong mga bata." Saway nya sa dalawa.

 

"Buti pa si Dama may gwapong love life." Maya-maya'y sabi ni Eula. She was looking ahead. Sinundan iyon ni Dama ng tingin at nakita niyang papalapit sa kanila si Pierre.

Nagulat naman sya ng biglang may humarang sa view nya. Si Zelo--na bigla na lang sumulpot mula sa kung saan.

"Oy. Uwi na tayo." He said coldly.

"Ha? Maaga pa ah?"

"Tss. Di wag." Naglakad ito paalis.

"Problema nun?" Tanong ng dalawa sa kanya.

Immediately, she fixed her things saka sya tumayo para sundan ito. "Uy guys, uwi na 'ko. May emergency ata sa bahay eh." Pagdadahilan nya.

Hindi na nakareklamo ang dalawa ng sundan nya si Zelo. She saw Pierre stop. Nakatingin lang ito sa kanila. 

 

"Uy teka!"

Pagkarinig sa boses nya ay binagalan nito ang paghakbang.

"Nagseselos ka na naman ba?" Mahina nyang tanong dito.

Hindi ito sumagot.

"Si Tassie asan?"

"Iniwan ko."

"You left her... for me?"

He stared blandly at her.

"Ayokong nilalapitan ka nya. Kapag nakita mo syang palapit sayo, lumayo ka na agad." Sabi nito sa kanya.

"Magtataka sila."

"Wala akong pakialam."

Gusto nyang ngumiti pero hindi nya magawa. Kinikilig sya pero hindi dapat ipakita. Ang hirap!

"Fine. I'll try." She said without cracking a smile.

 

"Tabi." Hinawakan sya nito sa kamay at bahagyang iniiwas sa dumadaang sasakyan. Then he let her hand go as quickly.

Pero malayo-layo naman ang sasakyan sa kanya kaya sa palagay nya'y gumagawa lang ito ng dahilan para hawakan ang kamay nya.

Lalo nya tuloy gustong ngumiti... pero dapat pigilan.

 

They were almost at the gate ng biglang mag-ring ang phone nya.

"Sino yan?" Tanong agad nito.

"Kapatid ko." She answered the call. "Hello." She said blandly.

"Hi ate. Kumusta?"

"Doing fine without you. And you?"

"I miss you ate." 

"Whatever."

"Birthday ko na bukas."


Napa-mental facepalm sya. She totally forgot that it was her brother's birthday tomorrow. Wala kaseng magpapaalala sa kanya.

"So?"

"Can I see you? Please?"

She sighed. Bakit naaalala nya si Meera ngayong naririnig nya ang boses ng kapatid? Nabubuhay na ba ang sisterly instinct nya?

"I have class tomorrow."

"Skip it. Please ate?"

She rolled her eyes. Bakit tinatamaan sya ng guilt?

"Fine. But I'm not available for the whole day okay?"

"Okay lang ate kahit one hour! Thank you!"

"Whatever. Happy birthday noob."

"Thank you! I love you ate!" She ended the call bago pa man sya makapagbitaw ng salitang pagsisisihan nya sa huli.

She never liked Dylan and she should never like him. He stole everything from her. He should be hated.

 

But why does that sound so wrong?

 

xxxxx

AN: Hi! So... nalihis ako sa plot. But no worries... parehas pa rin ang ending. Si Pierre pa rin talaga. Ang dami kaseng naghanap eh. Ayan... ayan na si Pierre. Inyong-inyo na. Akin na lang si Zelo. Haha...

COMMENT? 

PS. On-going ang story na 'to. Kung bitin... common sense na lang, 'kay? If you can't wait patiently (as if you'll wait that long--oh I pity you for waiting so long *note the sarcasm*)--find a finished story. Yun ang basahin mo.

Umintindi ng on-going story okay? Natural maghihintay ka ng UD. May trabaho ako. Konsiderasyon naman. Salamat.

Nobody gives a damn about the day that you were born.

Kinabukasan...

Usual routine. Usual route. Usual time. Usual companions.

Ang naiba? May nag-iintay na naman sa kanya sa may gate. Automatically, Zelo moved in front of her. He was guarding her. It's like... primitive instinct nito na protektahan ang sa kanya. She felt her insides flutter at the thought.

 

So... I'm his?

 

"Good morning!" Nakangiting bati ni Pierre sa kanya.

"Morning." She replied.

"Uh Dama... may gagawin ka ba mamayang lunch?" Tanong nito sa kanya.

"Kakain ng lunch." Zelo answered, as a matter-of-fact.

 

Nginitian ito ni Pierre. "Pilosopo ka rin eh no?"

"Nagtatanong ka lang kase, yung obvious pa." Pairap nitong sagot.

Inakbayan ni Eli si Zelo. "Pre halika na nga."

Pinalis ni Zelo ang kamay ni Eli. "Una ka na."

Eli sighed. Hinawakan nito si Zelo sa braso at hinila papasok sa school. "Hayaan mo na sila. Di magkakaboyfriend yang pinsan mo kung lagi mong babantayan." Naiiling nitong sabi.

 

Naiwan sina Dama at Pierre sa labas. Susunod kase dapat niya ang dalawa kaso hinarangan siya ng lalaki.

"So ano?" He inquired.

"Bakit mo ba tinatanong?" Medyo pikon nyang tanong.

"Wala lang." He said with a shrug. "Libre sana kita ng lunch."

"May pera ako." Sagot niya.

He touched her cheek. "Sungit mo naman."

 

Pinalis nya ang kamay nito. She dislikes his attitude. Presko ito masyado, straight-forward saka aggressive. Naiinis sya. Pano kase, umagang-umaga badtrip na naman si Zelo dahil dito. For sure, pag-uwi nya sa bahay mamaya ay magsusungit na naman ito.

"Ano ba!"

"Oh wag ka namang magalit. Pwede ka namang tumanggi kung ayaw mo eh."

"Fine. Ayoko. There!" She pushed him aside. "Tabi nga!" Saka sya nagtuloy-tuloy sa loob ng school.

 

--

 

She was right. Zelo was pissed. Halatang-halata sa mukha nito ang pagkairita. Hindi ito namamansin ng kahit na sino. Sobrang badtrip.

Nilapitan nya ito bago magsimula ang subject nila.

"Uy." Untag nya dito.

"Ano?" Iritado nitong tanong.

"Galit ka na naman." Puna niya.

"Pakialam mo ba." Nag-iwas ito ng tingin at sa bintana bumaling.

 

She sighed. "Di naman ako makikipag-date dun no. Asa sya."

"Ewan ko sayo."

Napasimangot sya. "Hindi nga. Birthday kaya ng kapatid ko ngayon, remember? Di ko alam kung anong oras nya ako tatagpuin eh. Baka nga mag-half day lang ako ngayon."

"So kaya hindi ka sasama eh dahil may iba kang lakad? Eh pano kung wala?"

"Eh di sasama." Biro nya dito.

He glared at her. 

 

"Joke lang."

"Bumalik ka na nga sa upuan mo. Nakakabadtrip ka lalo."

She pouted. "Ganyan ka na ha."

"Alis na."

"I hate you." Padabog syang bumalik sa upuan niya. Nasa kasulok-sulukan at kalikod-likuran kase si Zelo. Dun yun mahilig pumwesto kapag wala sa mood at ayaw makipag-usap kahit kanino.

Ngayon, dahil sa pagbibiro nya, lalo yatang sumama ang mood nito.

 

--

 

Lunch.

Papalabas na ng classroom si Dama ng bigla syang harangin ni Pierre.

"Hi." Nakangiti nitong bati.

She rolled her eyes. "Ano na naman?" 

"Aayain sana kitang mag-merienda. Since ayaw mo ng lunch..."

Tinusok-tusok sya ng magkapatid na Lei at Eula sa tagiliran. Imbes na sya ang kiligin, nauna pa yung dalawa.

"I'm not available."

"Dinner?" 

"No."

"Breakfast bukas?"

"Ayoko nga! No! Okay?" Nilampasan nya ito at dali-dali syang naglakad palayo sa mga nanunuksong kabarkada.

 

"It's a date then!" Narinig nyang pahabol nitong sigaw. Pinagtitinginan na sya ng mga tao sa pathway kaya lalo syang nairita.

 

Ang kapal ng mukha little heart! 

 

She was already outside the school when her phone rang.

"Oh?" 

"Ate! Nandito na 'ko sa--teka, mall ba 'to? Ang liit kase." 

She rolled her eyes. "Mall yan noob. A miniature mall."

Tumawa si Dylan sa kabilang linya. "Grabe ate, naikot ko na nga 'to in 15 minutes eh."

"Nasan ka ba dyan?"

"Nasa tapat ng Waltermart sa may info desk."

"Okay. Wait for me."

"Okay ate."

 

She ended the call at saka sya sumakay sa jeep. After a five-minute ride, bumaba sya sa mall at hinanap ang kapatid.

She saw him standing near the info desk. Naka-casual lang itong suot. Green polo shirt tapos khaki shorts at loafers. Kasalukuyan itong nagpipipindot sa cellphone... oblivious to the fact na ang daming babaeng nakatingin sa kanya.

For a fourteen yeaar-old kid, matangkad na ang kapatid nya. He's even taller than her. Mana kase ito sa daddy nila na matangkad din.

"Oy." She called out to him.

 

Ngumiti ito sa kanya, tumakbo palapit at yumakap.

"I miss you ate!"

"Tss." Kumawala sya dito. "Sino'ng kasama mo?"

"Sina Jes and Juni." Sagot nito.

She raised an eyebrow. Clearly, kahit sa paglabas-labas ng kapatid ay may nakabantay pa ring bodyguards. And not just any other bodyguards. Bihasa ang dalawa sa akido, judo at muay thai. Pareho rin itong magaling na snipers at may ranggo sa Marines bago sila ipinull-out ng lolo nila para maging bodyguards.

PSG nya si Jes originally. Mas maliit ito kay Juni but he's just as agile and experienced when it comes to fighting.

Hinanap nya ang mga ito. "Asan sila?"

"Nandyan lang sa tabi-tabi. Anyway, how are you ate?"

"Eto..." She motioned at herself. "Mukha ng dukha."

"Okay lang yan ate. Konting tiis pa."

"Palibhasa kase hindi ka nakakaranas ng buhay-mahirap. Try mo kayang mag-commute sa jeep. Hassle! Nagugulo ang buhok ko!" 

Ngumiti ito. "Kakapag-commute ko lang kaya."

 

"Weh?!" Nanlaki ang mata niya. Syempre hindi sya naniniwala. There's no way na makakapag-commute ang kapatid nya. Pero sabagay, sya nga eh... kahit hindi nya maimagine--nagawa nya.

Tumango ito. "Oo ate. And it's my third time commuting. Remember when mom asked you to go with her to Baclaran?"

Naalala nya bigla nung time na inaya siya ng mommy nya para mamili ng mumurahing damit sa Baclaran. Naka-shorts at simpleng t-shirt lang ito noon na kung hindi lang talaga sadyang maganda ay magmumukha ng katulong sa suot.

She remembered crinkling her nose and swearing that she'd rather die.

"Pano mo nalaman kung nasan ako?"

Dylan shrugged. "Naririnig ko lang sina mommy at daddy na nag-uusap."

"Grabe, tsismoso ka pala."

"Eh kase naman ate, gusto kong malaman kung nasan ka. I must say, nananaba ka. Masarap ba ang pagkaing mahirap?" Nakangiti nitong tanong.

 

Kapag galing sa kapatid nya ang biro, no matter how harsh it really is, no one would really notice. And frankly, no one would care. Well, except her. Para kase itong ang Tita Angel nya na kahit anong gawin ay hindi kagalit-galit... 

Charming ang kapatid nya. Precisely the reason why nandito sya sa pangmahirap na mall na ito ngayon wearing her cheap uniform.

All because of him.

All because her growing animosity towards her brother.

 

Her stomach grumbled. "Hungry?" He asked. She nodded. "Where shall we eat?"

"Kahit saan."

"Okay." Hinila sya nito sa kamay. "Ang tagal ko ng gustong kumain sa Jollibee, ngayon lang nagka-chance!" He exclaimed. 

Uh yeah... they weren't allowed to eat in any fast-food chain. Kung hindi home-cooked, dapat ay sa isang high-end restaurant sila kakain.

Always.

 

--

 

"I'll order... uh--N1, N2..."

"Parehas pong may drinks sir?" Tanong ng cashier.

"Ano bang drinks nyo ate?"

"Sprite. Coke. Iced tea. Pineapple sir."

"Iced tea na lang. Bawal sa 'kin ang soda eh." He answered.

"Sir automatic, large na po yun. Okay lang po?"

"Yeah yeah. And can you add those burgers? And fries please--large. Ooooh! Saka sundae ate."

Dama rolled her eyes at her kid brother.

"Really? Tingin mo mauubos mo yan?"

"Eh di ibigay sa iba yung matitira." He smiled sheepishly. "Ikaw ate, what do you like?"

"Chicken with spaghetti will do."

"Drinks nyo mam?"

"Coke."

"Regular po?"

"Hindi. Minsanan lang." Pabalbal nyang sagot sa cashier.

 

Buti na lang nga at mabait ang cashier kaya tumawa na lang ito.

"Si mam naman. Ano nga po?" Tanong ulit nito.

"Large."

 

Inulit ng cashier ang orders nila at saka sinabi ang presyo. Agad na kumuha si Dylan ng isang libo sa wallet nito. Sinilip nya ang laman ng wallet.... puro credit card. Tapos lilibuhin ang pera. Buti pa ang kapatid nya.

"Keep the change." Nakangiti nitong sabi sa cashier.

"Sir, sure kayo?" Takang-tanong nito.

Sinapok nya ito. "Hoy! Mahirap kumita ng pera! Anong keep the change ka dyan?" Hinarap nya ang cashier. "Yung sukli namin ha!"

"Opo. Yes po." Sagot nito at nagmadaling sinuklian ang magkapatid.

 

Nang makuha ang order, agad kumain ang dalawa. Ayaw man nyang aminin pero nakakatuwang panuoring kumain ang kapatid nya. Ang takaw kase...

"Kumusta na nga pala sa bahay?"

"Ayun." Uminom ito. "Tahimik palagi. Wala ka kase."

She sneered. "Tss. Si mommy?"

"Okay naman. Namimiss ka."

Napangiti sya sa sinabi ng kapatid. "Talaga?"

Tumango ito. "Yep. She bought a new cook book and is trying to learn bulalo. Alam mo bang galit na galit na si daddy kase palaging fail yung luto ni mommy? Ayun, ang daming naaaksaya. Ayaw namang magpatulong."

Tumawa sya. "Talaga? Kinakain nyo naman yung mga rejects?"

"Hindi ah! Ang sama kaya ng lasa! Nilalagyan nya kase ng sili!" Umiling-iling ito. "Ang adik ni mommy kapag buntis."

 

"Sina Tita ba nandito pa rin?"

"Yeah. Nagto-tour sila sa Bicol ngayon."

"Eh si Kolai? Buhay pa daw?"

Dylan laughed. "Bakit? Namimiss mo?"

"No way!" Ayaw na ayaw nya sa pinsan niya. She can never stand his pranks. Bata pa lang si Anzo ay sobra na ito sa kalikutan at katabilan. She was sure he just got worse.

 

Matapos kumain ay naglibot-libot ang magkapatid.

"You want to buy something?" He asked her.

"Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?"

He shrugged. Napadaan sila sa WOF. That's were he stopped. "Videoke tayo ate!" 

 

Hindi na sya nakatanggi ng bigla syang hilahin nito papasok sa WOF. Dere-deretso sila sa videoke room na mukhang may tao na.

At the corner of her eye, she saw Jes pay the staff.

"Wait Dy, may tao na yata--Dad!"

 

"Hey sweetie." Gulat na gulat si Dama ng makita ang ama na nakaupo sa isa sa mga upuan na nasa loob ng videoke room.

Agad syang yumakap dito.

"Daddy, I missed you!"

He kissed the top of her head. "I missed you too."

"Hi dad." Bati ni Dylan sa ama.

"Hey kid. Happy birthday."

 

"Daddy, si mommy asan?"

"She can't go sweetie... but she said hi."

Biglang nalungkot ang dalaga. "I guess she still doesn't want to see me." Malungkot niyang sabi sa ama.

"No sweetie... she wanted to see you so badly. Kaya lang kase, she feels that it's not yet the right time."

"Eh bakit ikaw dad? Why did she allow you to see me?"

 

"Takas lang si daddy ate. We'll be going to Amsterdam later tonight. Dun kase magsi-celebrate si daddy pagkatapos ng meeting nya with the CEO na dun din magaganap."

"Oh I almost forgot! Happy birthday daddy!" She kissed Dani on the cheek.

"Thanks sweetie. I still hope you can come with us though."

"Ang daya! I want to go there too!" Reklamo niya.

"Next year anak." Dani assured her. "So how's school?"

 

She blushed. Ewan ba nya, bakit kapag nababanggit ang school, naiisip nya si Zelo? 

"Why are you blushing?"

"Eeeee.... si ate... may boyfriend ka na no?" Tudyo ng kapatid niya.

"Uy wala ah!" Mariin nyang tanggi.

 

"Anak bawal muna ha? You need to graduate with high grades para makauwi ka na sa bahay. Namimiss ka na namin dun."

"Yes dad. I'll try."

 

Matapos ng kumustahan, bumirit ng kanta ang mag-ama. Tuwang-tuwa si Dylan kahit medyo masakit sa tenga ang mga boses nila. First family bonding kase nila na iba ang ugali ng ate nya.

Wala na yung maere, mapangmata at maarteng ate nya... siguro bits na lang nun.

 

He was glad... whatever is causing her to change... sana magtuloy-tuloy na.

AN: Lame... I know. Pasensya. Antok na antok na antok na ako. Salamat sa nag-antay ng UD. Ang pic ni Dylan Marco ay nasa group. Yun lang. Good night.

I said I'll never fall but I did.

--


Nakita ni Dama na umiling-iling ang ama habang binabasa ang text message sa phone nito na she's guessing eh galing sa mommy nya. Nakangiti kase ito.

He saw her looking at him. Ngumiti ito sa kanya.

"Ang kulit ng mommy nyo."

"Bakit dad?" Naupo sya sa tabi nito.

"She's been asking kung nasan na ako eh kakasabi ko lang sa kanya na nasa office ako." Tumawa ito.

"Maybe she knows you're lying. Malakas pa mandin ang kutob nun."

"You're right. I should be going now. Magagalit na talaga sa 'kin yun." Tumayo ito at yumakap kay Dylan. "Happy birthday son. Enjoy your date with ate."

"Thanks dad. Do you think papagalitan din ako ni mommy?" Nag-aalalang tanong nito. "I told her I'll be going to lolo's house."

Dani patted his son's head. "I don't think she believed you son. But don't worry.. di yun magagalit sa 'yo kase birthday mo."

 

Hindi nakatiis ang dalaga at niyakap din ang ama. "Ang bilis naman dad! Aalis ka na!" Reklamo nito.

"Sorry sweetie... babawi ako sa 'yo some other time." He kissed the top of her head.

Hinigpitan ni Dama ang yakap sa ama. "Hug mommy for me, okay dad?"

"Sure kiddo. Hug lang? Walang kiss?"

She slapped her father's arm. "Adik ka talaga dad!"

He laughed. "Oh sheesh... miss na miss na 'ko ng mommy nyo oh. Tumatawag na." He pulled out his phone from his pant's pocket.

 

"Have fun, you two. Okay?" Hinalikan nya sa pisngi ang magkapatid. "Bye! I love you guys!" Pahabol nito bago ito tuluyang lumabas ng videoke room.

Dama slumped back to her chair. Tinabihan naman sya ng kapatid at hinawakan ang kamay niya.

 

"Ate..."

"Oh ano?"

Ngumiti ito sa kanya. "May boyfriend ka na?"

"Wala ah!" Mariin nyang tanggi.

"Weh? Bakit parang masyado ka naman atang defensive?"

"Wag ka kaseng tanong ng tanong!"

"Hindi nga ate?"

"Wala nga." Tanggi ulit nya.

 

"But you're in love with someone, right?"

 

Pinandilatan nya ng mata ang kapatid. "N-No! Of course not! Love's for the weak-hearted. I'm not weak."

"Eeee... you're lying ate." Tinusok-tusok nito ang tagiliran nya.

"Ano ba!" She slapped his hand away.

 

Tumawa naman ito. "You know what ate?"

"What?"

"Mali ka."

"Saan?"

Dyla looked at the wall in front of them. "Love is not for the weak-hearted. I think it takes a lot of courage and strength to allow yourself to fall in love."

"Where did you get that?"

Ngumiti ito sa kanya. "I learned that from loving you ate."

Medyo natigilan sya sa sinabi ng kapatid. She tried weighing in his words... will she be mad or not?

"What are you trying to say?"

 

"I'm saying that not anyone can love you and stay by your side in spite of everything. Mommy, daddy and I--we all love you ate. I don't know why you can't seem to accept that."

She didn't say anything. Wala syang masabi eh. He's right. She can't accept that love. She always think that people do things for her for money or out of pity--because no one loves her.

She kept on blaming the people around her for her misery. She forgot that she kept them out for a long time.

Para hindi sya masaktan, hindi na lang nya tinatanggap ang pagmamahal na ibinibigay nila.

"Naiinggit nga ako sa 'yo ate eh. You know what? Whenever lolo and I would play chess, hindi ka nawawala sa usapan. He's always comparing me to you. There are times that I kinda feel a little inferior to you."

"Eh?"

"Yeah. I understand naman... paborito ka ni lolo eh."

"Ikaw kaya." She corrected.

"No. You still are. Ikaw lang naman kase eh, you don't see him anymore. Miss na miss ka na nga ni lolo eh."

"Well, he likes playing chess with you." She retorted.

"Only because you don't accept his invitations."

 

Nag-iwas sya ng tingin. "Si lolo Stephen lang naman ang may paborito sa 'kin eh. You have dad and mom."

Again, her brother shook his head.

"They only settle with me because they can't reach you. Feeling ko nga..." Napansin nyang medyo nag-crack ang boses nito. She glanced at him and saw that his eyes are moist.

"Na...?"

"Na--" He wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. "Sometimes I feel like they only love me because you're not there. Yung ganun... yung second option."

Nagsimula na itong umiyak.

"U-Uy..."

"S-Sorry. I didn't mean to cry." Ngumiti ito sa kanya. "Let's sing again?"

 

Niyakap niya ang kapatid. "I'm sorry if I ever made you feel that way." Sabi niya dito bago pa man niya mapigilan ang sarili.

He hugged her back. 

"I love you ate."

Binatukan nya ito. "Bakit ba ang bait-bait mo? Nakakainis ka!"

"If I'm not as kind... baka wala ng magmahal sa 'kin. Ikaw kahit ganyan ka, maraming nagmamahal sa 'yo. Unlike me..."

"Sira! I love you, okay?"

"Eh? Talaga ate?" Ngiting-ngiti ito. She rolled her eyes. Naisahan na naman sya.

"Wag mong sasabihin kahit kanino ha?"

"Ay..." he pouted. "Bakit naman?"

"Wala. Ayoko lang."

"Okay lang ate. Thank you. This is the best birthday ever!"

"It's not over yet." Tumayo sya at hinila rin patayo ang kapatid. "Come on! I'll make you eat street food."

 

--

 

Umuwi ang dalaga ng may baong ngiti... at ATM card na naglalaman ng sampung libong piso. Binigay kase sa kanya ni Dylan. Nakailang tanggi na sya dito pero mapilit ito.

Pagkauwi sa bahay ay nadatnan niya si Zelo na nanunuod ng TV. Pero syempre joke lang yun kase wala silang TV.

Nakahilata ito sa pangmahirap nilang upuan at nagbabasa. She's guessing na may quiz na naman sila bukas sa kung saang subject.

"Uy."

"Hoy." Pabalik nitong bati sa kanya.

"May quiz bukas?"

"Wala."

"Eh bat ka nagbabasa?"

"Masamang magbasa?"

"Tss. Galit ka pa rin?"

"Di." Sagot nito.

 

Ibinato niya ang ATM card dito. "Oh yan."

"Ano 'to?" Kunot noo nitong tanong.

"Budget natin for the next month."

"Bat mo binibigay sa 'kin?"

She shrugged. "Wala. Ikaw na maghawak. Baka magastos ko eh."

 

Ibinalik nito ang card sa kanya.

"Ikaw na maghawak nyan."

"Eh baka nga kase magastos ko."

"Kailangan mo ng matutong mag-budget. Pano na lang kapag wala na ako sa tabi mo?"

Sinimangutan nya ito.

"What do you mean?"

"Wala lang."

 

It's not nothing to her. It's like may gustong iparating sa kanya ang lalaki. Sa totoo lang, no matter how much she miss her old life... parang nakakasanayan na rin niya ang ganitong buhay. 

Simple...

Saka maraming nagmamahal sa kanya.

She have friends.

Wala syang kaaway... di tulad sa dati.

 

--

 

"Where have you been? I've been calling your office kanina pa! Wala ka naman daw dun!" Galit na salubong ni Megan sa asawa.

Dani laughed and greeted his wife with a hug... na galing sa panganay nyang anak.

"D-Dad--I can't breathe!"

"Sorry. That's from your daughter by the way." He said with a smile.

"Really?"

"Yeah. She even asked me to give you this." He stooped down and kissed her.

Bahagya sya nitong itinulak.

"She did not ask you to give me that!" She eyed him with suspicion.

"Yes she did." 

"Oh?" Meg raised an eyebrow. "So you kissed?"

"Haha! Oo nga no."

"Hmm... daddy ha."

"Yes mommy?" He nipped at her jawline.

"Stop--ano ba dad! Galit pa 'ko sa 'yo!"

 

 Tumawa ito. "Masama ang magalit ma."

"I hate you. You lied to me!"

He pinched her nose. "You lied to me too. So patas lang."

Pinalis ni Meg ang kamay nya. "No I did not!"

"Whatever ma... so... where were we?"

"Nasa sala." She rolled her eyes at him. "Tamo, pinagpipyestahan na naman tayo ng mga katulong."

 

Nagsingitian naman ang mga nakarinig.

"Anyway dad, how is she?"

"Ayun. Nananaba... parang ikaw."

Kinurot sya nito sa tagiliran. "Ako na naman." 

He kissed her again.

 

"Seriously ma... I think she's happier."

Megan smiled. "Good to know. Do you think it's advisable na pabalikin ko na sya dito?"

"I don't know. Do you?" Pagbabalik nito ng tanong sa kanya.

 

Hindi ito sumagot.










Will it be too early to bring her back?

AN: Puyat. Good night.

I did not give you the license to talk... so shut the hell up.

Hindi pa rin maalis sa isip ni Dama ang sinabi ng binata. She refuses to believe na magkakahiwalay pa sila. She hated the thought of being away from him. Unti-unti pa nga lang nag-a-unfold yung feelings nila sa isa't isa tapos matatapos agad?

No. It can't be.

"Oy." He poked her cheek. "Tulala ka na naman."

Nginitian nya na lamang ito. 

"Nag-review ka na?"

"Hindi pa nga eh." Sagot niya dito.

"Ako rin nga eh! Bakit naman kase ang lapit lapit ng midterm sa pre-fi?" Reklamo ni Eula.

"Dapat nga wala ng pre-fi eh. Tamo next month, finals na agad. Tss." Dagdag ni Eli.

"Haynako. Puro kayo reklamo. Uso din naman kase yung makinig sa lecture." Pangangaral ni Lei sa mga kabarkada.

 

"Tell you what guys..." Tumayo si Dama at pumunta sa harapan ng mga kaibigan. "Group study tayo mamaya?"

"You mean inuman?" Lei rolled her eyes.

She shrugged. "Well, depende sa inyo kung sasamahan nyo ng alak." Nginitian nya ang mga ito. "So? Ano?"

Nakita nyang nagkamot ng ulo si Zelo. "Ano kase--"

 

She stared at him blandly. "Ano? Di ka na naman pwede?"

"Kase--"

"Skip it." Mariin nitong sabi.

"Hindi pwede--"

"Hep! I don't wanna hear any excuses. We need you." She gave him a look.

"Tss." Napabuntong-hininga ito. "Okay. Sige."

 

Dama beamed at him. "There. It's settled then. Saan tayo mag-a-aral?"

"Kina Eula." Itinuro ni Eli ang magkapatid.

"Samin na naman?" Reklamo ni Eula.

"Eh san pa? Kina Zelo?"

Sabay silang umiling ng binata.

"Di pwede sa 'min." Sagot ng binata.

"Walang space dun." Dagdag naman niya.

"Sa inyo Eli?" Nilingon ng barkada si Eli.

"Di pwede! Mauubos ang paninda namin sa inyo." Tanggi nito.

 

"O eh san? Wala naman tayong tutuluyan eh. Wag na lang kaya?" Lei said.

"Sa 'min na lang."

 

Si Keeme--sa wakas ay nagsalita rin.

 

"Yun! Kina Keeme na lang ha! Ano? What time?"

"Mga 6 siguro? 4pm naman uwi natin ngayon di ba?"

"Sige, kita-kita tayo dito ha."

"Bibili ba tayo ng alak?"

"At talagang may balak mag-inom?"

"Dali na! Para masaya!"

"Loko! May pasok bukas!"

"Hapon pa naman eh!"

"Isang bote lang!"

"Dalawa naman!"

"O sya. Beer lang ha."

"Yung hard naman!"

"Kapag kayo walang naisagot bukas!"

 

Natawa na lang si Dama sa convo nila. Pano kase, sabay-sabay kung magsalita ang mga ito. Hindi na sila nagkakaintindihan pero nagkaintindihan sila. Basta. Ang gulo.

 

--

 

Dalawang sakay ang ginawa nila papunta kina Keeme dahil sa kabilang bayan pa ang bahay nito. Bumaba sila sa palengke and from there ay naglakad ang mga ito papunta sa bahay ng kabarkada.

"Hoy. Holding hands tayo?" She suggested to them.

"Huh?" Nilingon sya ng limang naka-kunot ang noo.

"Wala lang. Partner partner tayo kunware."

 

Si Eula, na mukhang nagets agad ang sinasabi ng kaibigan, ay agad na hinila ang kamay ni Eli.

"Game!"

Agad na humawak si Dama sa kamay ni Zelo. "Oh yan... kayo naman Lei!" 

Nagkatinginan sina Zelo at Eli... at saka lang nila nagets kung anong gustong mangyari ng dalawang babae.

"Oo nga. Bawal ang KJ." Nakagiting sabi ni Zelo sa dalawa who were just awkwardly standing there.

"Seriously? Bakit sya partner ko?" Reklamo ni Lei.

 

"Ang bagal nyo kaseng kumilos. Ayan, no choice kayo."

Napadabog si Lei. "Ayoko!"

"Makatanggi 'to akala mo naman gusto ko syang kapartner." Pikon na sabi ni Keeme sa dalaga.

His friends exchanged knowing looks with him. Alam na.

 

"Ayaw nyo? Sige... sagot nyo ang alak mamaya." Banta ni Dama sa dalawa.

"Fine!" Sagot agad ni Lei. "Lunurin ko pa kayo sa alak eh." Inis na sabi nito at saka naglakad palayo sa kanila.

Naiiling na bumitaw si Eula kay Eli at pinasundan dito ang kapatid. Si Keeme naman ang hinawakan nito sa braso.

"Wag ka ngang totorpe-torpe dyan!" She hissed at him.

"Anong torpe? Ulul!"

 

Binatukan ito ni Eula.

"Tatanggi ka pa eh!"

"Haynako Keeme. Walang mararating yang katorpehan mo." Sabat ni Dama sa dalawa.

"Wag nga kayong magmura!" Naiinis nitong sabi sa dalawa.

"Halata ka na pre. Wag ka ng tumanggi." Nakangiting dagdag ni Zelo.

"Mapaggawa kayo ng issue. Tss."

"Asus."

 

Hinila ito ni Eula para sundan sina Lei at Eli na medyo malayo na rin ang nalalakad.

 

Sumunod na rin si Dama at Zelo sa mga ito.

"Para-paraan?" Nakangiting tanong nito sa kanya.

"Ikaw kase..." Ungot niya dito.

"Ano na naman?"

"Wala."

"Ano nga?"

She sighed. "Alam ko kaseng hindi mo 'to gagawin eh kaya ako na ang nag-initiate."

She felt him squeeze her hand. "Hindi nga." Sabi nito saka sya hinalikan sa pisngi. "Pero yan, kaya kong gawin." Sabi nito sabay ngiti.

Hinampas nya ito sa balikat. "Hoy Zelo umayos ka! Ang daming tao!"

 

They were just exiting the market for Pete's sake! Pano na lang kung may makakita sa kanila? Or worse, kung nilingon sila ng mga kaibigan at that exact moment?

Tumawa ito. "Wala yan. Di naman tayo kilala ng mga yan."

"Eh pano na lang kung meron tayong schoolmate dito?!"

Nagkibit-balikat lang ito.

 

She got confused with the way he's acting. Masyado naman yata itong reckless? What if someone finds out about them?

 

--

 

Sa bahay nina Keeme... Walang tao kundi sila.

"Nasan ang parents mo Keeme?" Tanong nya rito.

"Mama ko nasa Canada."

"Eh ang papa mo?"

"Nasa bahay ni San Pedro." Matabang nitong sagot. Saka ito naglakad papuntang kusina.

 

"Five pa lang si Keeme ng mapatay sa duty ang papa nya."

"Ha?"

"Sundalo kase."

"Eh bakit nasa Canada ang mama nya?" Takang-tanong nya sa mga ito. What kind of woman would leave her child alone on another country?

"Nagtatrabaho."

"Eh bakit nandito si Keeme sa Pilipinas? Hindi ba sya pwedeng isama dun?"

 

"May iba na kaseng pamilya si mama."

 

Nilingon nya si Keeme. May dala itong isang bote ng coke saka mga disposable na baso ng magkakasuson.

"Sorry to hear that."

He shrugged. "Ayos lang. Sanay naman akong mag-isa."

 

He asked them to go upstairs. Sumunod naman sila dito. Dun sila tumambay sa kwarto nito. Ang linis.

Isang kama lang na mababa at isang cabinet ang nandun. May laptop na nakapatong sa table saka wii at xbox na nakalagay sa ilalim.

May isang malaking flat screen TV na nakadikit sa pader. Tapos may maliit na ref na nasa sulok.

Yun lang.

 

Walang kalat.

Walang posters.

Walang pictures...

 

No sign of life basically.

 

"May alak nga pala sa ref." Keeme pointed at the fridge on the corner. "Ubusin nyo kung gusto nyo."

Naupo ito sa gilid ng kama.

 

Inilapag nila ang mga gamit sa may pader at saka binuksan ni Lei ang ref at naglabas ng isang bote ng liquor.

"Mag-aaral ba muna o mag-iinom?" Tanong nito.

"Eitherway, wala tayong matatandaan bukas."

"Wag na ngang mag-review!" Reklamo ni Eli.

 

And so they didn't.

 

--

 

Matapos ang tatlong bote ng alak, lasing na silang anim. Si Lei, nakasandal na sa balikat ni Keeme na katabi nito nung mga oras na yun. Nakapikit na ito at mukhang tulog na.

"Kelan ka ba magsasabi sa kanya ha Keeme?"

Umirap ito. "Ewan ko sa inyo."

"So hindi ka pa talaga aamin sa 'min?"

"Wala nga akong aaminin!" Mariin nitong sabi.

"Tss. Akala ko ba kapag lasing... honest?"

"Matulog na nga kayo. Ang gugulo nyong kausap." Iritado nitong sabi. Itinulak nito si Lei papunta kay Eli. "Ihiga nyo na nga yan. Iinom-inom di naman kaya."

Tumayo ito at naglakad papunta sa pintuan ng kwarto niya.

"Dama, Eula... tabi-tabi na lang kayo. Kami nina Eli sa sahig na lang." Pagkasabi'y lumabas ito ng pintuan.

 

--

 

Lumabas din si Dama para uminom ng tubig sa kusina. Yung fridge kase ni Keeme is strictly for alcohol only.

Sumunod din si Zelo dito.

Naabutan nila si Keeme na nakaupo sa sahig ng nakabukas na pintuan sa may CR. Back door ata yun. Naninigarilyo ito.

"Oy." Untag ni Zelo dito.

Kumuha si Dama ng tubig sa ref at uminom. Nagsalin ulit sya ng tubig sa baso at iniabot yun kay Zelo.

Kinuha nito iyon at ininom.

 

"Kayo yata ang may kailangang aminin eh." Keeme said.

"Ha?" Halos sabay na tanong ng dalawa.

"Hindi naman kayo magpinsan di ba?"

"Ano ba yang pinagsasasabi mo? Lasing ka na nga," Dama laughed nervously.

"Hindi ako tanga kaya wag na kayong tumanggi. Hindi ko naman sasabihin sa kanila eh. Alam ko namang may dahilan kayo kung bakit nyo ginagawa yan." Sagot nito.

 

Naupo si Zelo at sumandal sa pader na malapit sa binata.

 

"Pano mo nalaman?"

 

Keeme sneered. "Ayusin nyo kase yung mga details nyo. Namamali kayo ng sagot eh." Nginitian nya ang dalawa. "Naaalala nyo nung tinanong ko kayo ng random questions?"

Dama remembered. Akala naman nya makakalimutan nito iyon kaya nag-imbento na lang sya ng mga sagot. Hindi naman nya alam na tinanong din pala nito si Zelo without her knowledge.

Siguro ay magkaiba sila ng naisagot.

 

"Bakit kayo nagpapanggap?" Tanong nito sa kanila.

 

"Masyado pang complicated ngayon eh. You wouldn't tell them, would you?" Nag-aalalang tanong ni Dama dito. They would surely get mad. Bakit nga naman nila itatago sa mga ito na hindi sila magpinsan? Bakit hindi na lang nila sinabi noong una pa lang na hindi sila magpinsan, di ba?

Bakit pa nila kelangang maglihim?

Ayaw nyang isipin ang magiging reaction nina Eula kapag nalaman ng mga ito. Lalo na si Eula... baka magtampo ito sa kanya.

"Pakabait ka sa 'kin ng hindi ko sabihin."

"Eeeee... Wala namang ganyanan Keeme!"

Tumawa ito.

"Mag-ingat-ingat na lang kayo. Hindi ko na kayo papakialaman pero kung ano man yang dahilan nyo, sana mabigat yan para maglihim kayo sa 'min."

"Oo mabigat to pre. Pramis."

 

Dama sighed. Eto na ba talaga? Malapit na ba talaga syang bumalik sa dati nyang buhay? Senyales na ba ito?

"Since alam mo na din lang ang sikreto namin... pwede bang aminin mo na rin sa 'min na may gusto ka kay Lei?" Tanong ni Zelo dito.

"Wala nga."

"Asus! Sabi nina Eula meron daw!"

"Wala nga! Kahit sya pa ang kahuli-hulihang babae sa mundo, hinding-hindi ako magkakagusto sa kanya." He said with conviction.

"That... or you're just scared to admit it dahil malaki ang possibility na magkabalikan sila ng ex nya?" Dama eyed him with scrutiny. "That's it, isn't it? Where will that leave you nga naman kung saka-sakali?"

Keeme rolled his eyes at her. "Sinabi ng--bahala ka nga. 'Wag kang maniwala."

"Bahala ka. Ikaw din..."

"Bakit ba sa 'kin napunta ang usapan? Ako na naman ang trending? Di ba kayo dapat?"

"Eh tapos na yung samin."

"Hindi pa kaya!"

"Eh ano pa ba ang pag-uusapan tungkol sa 'min?" Tanong niya sa binata.

 

Nagpabalik-balik ang tingin nito sa kanilang dalawa. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Hindi ba may relasyon kayo?"

xxxx

AN: LSS. Yung video sa kanan. Kaadik! Ayun... ewan ko kung ano yung tinype ko. As usual... antok na naman. haha...

You're an asshole but I love you.

 

--

 

Dahil lasing ang magkakaibigan... napatagal sila ng pagtulog. Nalaman na lang nilang alas onse na ng magsisigaw si Eula na late na sila.

Kanya-kanyang pagkukumahog ang anim. Mabuti na nga lamang at dalawa ang CR nina Keeme. At ang kaawa-awang si Dama... ipinanghuli kase sya daw ang pinakamabagal kumilos.

Alas dose na pero naliligo pa rin ang magkapatid. Tapos na ang mga lalaki kaya ginamit ni Lei yung isang banyo. Si Dama, naiwang nakaupo sa sofa at aligagang naghihintay.

 

12:10pm ng sa wakas ay natapos na rin si Eula. Agad na nagpunta ng banyo si Dama para maligo.

 

--

 

1:08pm... ng matapos sya. Sa sobrang kamamadali hindi pa sya nakapag-conditioner. She put on her undergarments saka sya lumabas ng banyo.

Nagulat sya paglabas dahil tahimik.

 

Sobrang tahimik.

 

Nanlumo sya. Iniwan na sya ng mga barkada. Gusto nyang maiyak. Hindi pa naman nya alam ang pabalik sa school. First time nya kaseng makapunta kina Keeme. She might have remembered the way back pero ayaw nyang magbyaheng mag-isa.

Lalo na't nadi-depress sya. Sino ba namang hindi malulungkot kung iniwan ka ng barkada mo ng wala man lang pasabi?

"Grabe ang tagal mong maligo!"

"U-Uy!" Nagulat siya ng bigla na lamang sumulpot si Zelo mula sa kung saan.

"Ano tatanga pa? Kilos na! Late na tayo!"

"Umalis na sila?" Nagsuot sya ng palda. Bihis na ito at mukhang kanina pa sya inaantay. Dapat magmadali sya dahil mukhang inis na ito kaiintay ng matagal sa kanya.

"Kanina pa."

"Bakit di ka pa sumama? Baka hindi ka makapag-exam dahil sa 'kin." She buttoned up her blouse. Saka sya naghagilap ng suklay sa bag.

 

"Alangan namang iwanan kita?"

 

She ran towards him saka nya ito niyakap--with her wet hair and all.

"Zelo!"

"Tss. Nababasa ako." Itinulak sya nito palayo. Saka ito humarap sa salamin na nasa sala at binuksan ang electric fan para patuyuin ang polo nito na nabasa ng buhok nito.

"Sorry na... nalate ka tuloy." Sabi niya dito.

"Ayos lang. Bilisan mo na dyan."

Binilisan nya ang pagsusuklay kahit na halos mahila ang anit nya sa ganit ng buhok nya. Yan ang hirap ng walang conditioner eh. Nagmamadali kase sya.

 Nilapitan sya ni Zelo at inagaw nito sa kanya ang suklay.

 

"Upo." Utos nito. Naupo sya.

Marahan nitong sinuklay ang buhok nya. She smied... hindi ito masakit magsuklay. It's as if he knows his way around her hair para maiwasan nito na mahila ang buhok nya or ma-scrape ang anit nya. Ingat na ingat ito and at the same time ay mabilis kumilos.

Wala pang limang minuto ay nasuklay na nito ang buhok nya.

"Thank you." She said to him.

"Tara na."

"Teka! Mag-aayos pa ako!"

"Wag na!"

Hinila sya nito towards the door.

She tugged at his hand.

"Teka--I can't go out like this!"

 

Nilingon sya nito, his face was painted with irritation.

"Ano na naman?"

"Paglipstick-in mo man lang ako." Pakiusap nya dito.

"Wag na. Maganda ka na. Tara na!"

"Eeeee..."

 

He sighed. Hinawakan sya nito sa tigkabilang pisngi. Saka nito bahagyang itinaas ang corners ng labi nya, forming them into a smile.

"Yan na lang ang isuot mo... kumpleto ka na."

 

Napangiti sya sa sinabi nito.

"Talaga bang maganda ako kahit walang makeup?" She wiggled her eyebrows at him.

Napatawa ito. Saka sya tinapik-tapik sa ulo. "Oo nga."

Yumakap sya dito. "Kiss mo nga ako kung talaga?"

Nailing ito. "Adik. Late na talaga tayo."

"Dali na!" She demanded.

"Ang kulit mo rin eh noh?"

"Late na rin naman kase tayo, bakit di pa sulitin?"

"Hmm..." Pinisil-pisil nito ang pisngi nya. "Kapag ako bumagsak mamaya, lagot ka sa 'kin."

"Kiss mo na kase ako ng makaalis na tayo." Nakangiti nyang sagot dito. 

 

Yumuko naman itong si Zelo... acting as if he's gonna kiss her. Dama closed her eyes and waited for his lips. Kaso nag-ring yung phone nya. Kinuha iyon ni Zelo habang sya naman ay nagdadabog.

"Hello?" He paused. "Oo. Paalis na. Eh ang tagal kaseng maligo! Oo. Sige." He ended the call.

"Kainis! Timing kung timing!" She murmured, irritated.

"Tara na." Kinuha ni Zelo ang mga nagkalat niyang gamit at pinaglalagay agad nito iyon sa bag niya. Saka sya nito hinila palabas ng bahay.

He locked the door and dragged her to the streets.

 

"Zelo... yung kamay ko."

 

"Kinakaladkad kita. Natural hahawakan ko ang kamay mo." Sagot nito na hindi man lang sya nililingon.

"Para-paraan?" Natatawa nyang tanong. Hindi ito sumagot.

 

--

 

Pawis-pawisan sila agad dahil lakad-takbo sila papunta sa sakayan ng jeep. Mga after 20 minutes, nakarating na rin sila sa school. Second exam na yung naabutan nila pero pinahabol din naman sila nung prof. Kaso nga lang ay nahati sa dalawang exam yung isang oras nila kaya pareho silang kabado.

Pero sabagay... dapat nga kabahan silang lahat.

Wala namang nag-review eh.

 

--

 

Matapos ang exam... parang nakahinga ng maluwag lahat ng estudyante. Yung feeling na kahit alam mong wala kang naisagot--at least tapos na... yung para ngayong araw. Kase meron pang exams bukas.

"Wala ng group study mamaya ha? Leche lang. Wala naman tayong narereview!" Reklamo ni Lei.

"Oo nga. Naglaway ka nga lang sa kama ko eh." Sabat ni Keeme.

"Uy teka... ano'ng sagot nyo sa number 15 kanina?" Tanong ni Eli sa magbabarkada.

"Ay ano ba Eli. Kalimutan mo na yun! Tapos na eh!"

"Nagtatanong lang naman eh."

"O ano? San tayo?"

"Eh di uuwi."

"Uwi agad? Ang aga-aga pa eh."

"San nyo gustong pumunta?"

"Oy hindi pa pala tayo kumakain!"

 

Nagkatinginan silang anim. And by the mere mention of food, saka lang nila naaalang hindi pa nga pala sila kumakain. Para kaseng pakiramdam nila ay puno yung tiyan nila dahil sa alak kagabi.

"San tayo?" Pag-uulit ni Zelo sa naunang tanong.

"Parang gusto ko ng lugaw." Sagot ni Eula.

"Alas-kwatro--lugaw?" 

"Eh san nyo ba kase gusto?"

 

Walang nakasagot.

"Umuwi na nga lang tayo." Aya ni Eli. Nagsitanguan sila.

"Ay teka--naiwan ko yata bolpen ko. Una na kayo." Naglakad si Eula pabalik ng classroom habang hinahalungkat ang bag.

Naglakad na naman palabas ng gate sina Eli at Lei.

Inakbayan silang dalawa ni Keeme.

 

 "Oy... kumusta kayo?"

Tiningnan nila ito ng parehong nakakunot ang noo. "Ano'ng kumusta?" Tanong ni Zelo.

"Yung exams? Ayun... bagsak kami pareho." Sagot naman ni Dama.

Ngumiti si Keeme. "So talagang magpi-pretend kayo na wala tayong pinag-usapan kagabi?"

"Huh? Lasing ka kaya nun. Di ka na nga makausap ng matino eh."

 

Tinanggal ni Keeme ang mga braso niya sa balikat nila. Saka ito umuna sa paglalakad. Nang mga dalawang metro na ang layo nito mula sa kanila, nilingon sila nito.

"Sige lang. Mag-pretend kayo hanggat gusto nyo. Tandaan nyo lang na walang lihim na hindi nabubunyag." Paalala nito sa kanila. Saka ito tuluyang umalis.

 Nagkatinginan silang dalawa.

"Pano na? Baka sabihin nya kina Eula." Nag-aalalang tanong ng dalaga.

"Hindi yan." 

"How confident are you na hindi sya magsasalita?" Tanong nya sa binata.

"Basta." Pinisil nito ang pisngi nya. "Uwi na tayo."

 

"Zelo!"

Napasimangot ang dalaga ng makitang naglalakad si Tassie palapit sa kanila. Kumaway ito sa kanya bago kumawit sa braso ni Zelo.

"Tapos na exam nyo?" Tanong nito sa binata.

Tumango si Zelo. "Kakatapos lang. Kayo?"

"Tapos na rin. Gala tayo?"

Tumingin muna si Zelo sa kanya. Tiningnan din tuloy sya ni Tassie.

"Uy sama ka?"

"No thanks. Mag-rereview pa ako para bukas." She gave Tassie a forced smile bago sya umalis.




Ako sasama? Para ano? Maging third wheel? No way!

 

Padabog syang naglalakad. Mabangga na kung sinong mababangga. Wala syang pakialam. Inis sya eh.

"Hello!" Untag sa kanya ng isang lalaki na halos ay kabungguan na niya. She stopped walking and looked up.

"Pierre?"

 

--

 

Nakaupo si Eula sa may volleyball court. May inaantay kase sya.

"Eula."

She smiled when she saw James.

"Uy kuya!"

Naupo ito. "Wag namang kuya." Pakiusap nito sa kanya.

"Ang tangkad mo kase eh." Nakangiti nyang sabi dito.

Tumawa ito. "Ano namang kinalaman ng tangkad dun?"

"Wala wala. Ano? Nakuha mo ba?"

"Matagal na 'kong meron nun. Eto oh." Ibinigay nito ang isang piraso ng papel sa kanya. May labing-isang numerong nakasulat doon.

"Waaaah! Thanks kuya!"

Hinablot nito ang papel from her hand.

"Kuya na naman." Reklamo nito.

"Ay sorry. JAMES pala." She smiled at him ng ibalik nito ang papel sa kanya. "Alam ba ni Jairus na kinuha ko yung number nya?"

"Sanay na yun."

"Ay ganun?" Napasimangot sya. Right. Baka nga naman kase halos lahat ng may crush dito ay nagtetext dito. Baka nga makadagdag pa sya sa sakit ng ulo nito.

"Malungkot ka na naman? Eto oh." Inabutan sya nito ng isang Hearshey's Treats. "Wag kang mag-alala. Sabi ko kay Jai hindi ka fangirl at gusto mo lang makipagkaibigan. I guess okay lang sa kanya kase sabi ko friend din kita."

Napangiting muli ang dalaga.

"Talaga? Thank you ha! Saka dito sa chocolates." She stood up. "Sige, alis na 'ko."

Tumango ito sa kanya. "Ingat."

 

--

 

"Ano ba! How dare you drag me here!" Reklamo ni Dama. Basta na lang kase syang hinila ni Pierre pasakay ng jeep. Bumaba silang dalawa sa mall at dumeresto sa World of Fun.

"Gusto lang kitang pasayahin kase malungkot ka. Bakit? Bagsak ka sa exams?" Nakangiti nitong tanong sa kanya.

"Of course not! Nag-aral ako noh..." Kahit hindi.

"Eh bakit ka malungkot?"

"None of your business, okay?" She tried to pull her hand away from him but he didn't let go.

"Tara laro tayo!" Aya nito saka sya kinaladkad papasok sa loob ng WOF.

 

Aaminin ng dalaga na medyo nawiwili sya sa paglalaro. Pano ba naman kase, parang play all you want ang peg nitong si Pierre. Libre lahat ng tokens nila tapos ang galing pa nito sa arcade kaya ang dami dami na nilang tickets.

Next stop nila ay yung may kinukuhang stuff toy sa loob ng glass box with a crane. Nagpapakuha sya ng stuff toy na Simsimi.

Tutok na tutok ito sa paglalaro when she felt something.

 

Like someone is watching her.

 

Nagpalinga-linga sya and then she was met by the cold gaze of Zelo. Nasa hindi kalayuan ito at hawak ang kamay ng girlfriend na bumibili ng soft ice cream.

Mataman itong nakatingin sa kanya.

She felt guilty--like she was just caught cheating. Hindi nya dapat iyon nararamdaman pero bakit? In the first place, hindi naman sila... pero bakit nagi-guilty sya?

"Yes! Nakuha ko na!" Pierre exclaimed.

 

Nginitian nya ito ng ibigay nito ang stuff toy sa kanya.

 

Then when she wasn't looking, he stole a kiss from her on her cheek. Tiningnan nya ito ng masama.

Saka hinanap ng mata nya si Zelo. Hindi na ito nakatingin sa kanya at mukhang busy ito sa pakikipag-usap sa girlfriend.

His face is unreadable.

 

Nakita kaya nya little heart?

 

xxxxx

AN: WELCOME BACK LITTLE HEART! NAMISS KITA! HAHAHA... UMUUSO KA NA NAMAN KASE VALENTINE'S!!!!

Ayun, 100K reads na ang TFRB... sana mabasa nyo rin. Light lang naman sya, di gaya nito na heavy.

Okay. Yun lang. ^_^




May mga like page din po sila, baka gusto nyo lang namang i-like. XD

Good night! ^3^

*******************************************
[31] Chapter 30
*******************************************
I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one.

 

--

 

She was right. He was angry. Pagkadating niya sa bahay ay hindi sya pinapansin nito. Ni hindi sya nito tinitingnan. He was completely ignoring her like she was some bad air that he can't see. Kahit sa pagkain, hindi pa rin sya nito pinapansin.

She tried to make small conversations with him tulad ng pagpapaabot ng pagkain dito pero wala pa rin itong imik.

Talagang hindi sya kinakausap.

 

Nagtataka naman ang mag-ina sa kanilang dalawa. It was very unusual for Manang Pacing and Meera to see them like this. Yung tahimik at walang kibuan.

Mas normal pa sigurong tingnan magsisigawan silang dalawa at magbabatuhan ng plato.

 

--

 

Pagkatapos kumain ay agad na tumayo si Zelo mula sa hapag-kainan at hinugasan ang pinagkainan nito. Saka ito lumabas ng bahay.

She was left to wash the rest of the dishes...

 

Matapos nyang mahugasan lahat ng pinagkainan, sinundan nya ang binata sa likod-bahay. Alam nya kaseng doon ito tumatambay kapag badtrip.

She saw him smoking.

Naiiling niyang nilapitan ito at kinuha ang sigarilyo mula rito saka niya ito itinapon at tinapak-tapakan hanggang sa mamatay ang apoy.

"If you're angry with me, don't take it out by smoking. Pwede ka namang magsabi di ba?" She reprimanded him. Naupo sya sa tabi nito. "Bakit ka ba nagagalit?"

"Tinatanong mo pa talaga?"

"Pano ko kase malalaman kung hindi mo sasabihin? Hindi ako manghuhula Zelo!" She hissed.

Nilingon sya nito. His face contorted in anger.

"Akala ko ba uuwi ka na? Bakit magkasama kayo kanina?"

"Hinila nya lang ako, okay? I didn't want to go with him."

"Hindi ka naman nya makakaladkad hanggang mall kung ayaw mo talagang sumama eh. Ang sabihin mo, gusto mo ring sumama sa kanya."

Napapikit ang dalaga sa inis. She was trying to count from 1 to 10 para mabawasan ang inis niya sa lalaki.

"And what if I did? Bakit ka nagagalit sa 'kin? Single naman kami pareho ah?"

 

He didn't reply.

 

"Tama naman ako di ba? Bakit ka magagalit sa 'kin? Boyfriend ba kita? Tayo ba? Ha?" Dagdag pa niya.

"Hindi pa ba understood yun? Sinabi ko ng gusto kita, di ba?"

"But that's not enough!" She said in frustration. "Gusto mo nga ako... but you're still with her! And what does that make me-spare tire?"

"Ano pa bang gusto mong gawin ko?!" He retorted.

 

"Break up with her."

 

Napabuntong-hininga ito.

"Alam mo namang hindi pwede."

"Bakit hindi pwede?! Kung hindi mo sya gusto, why let her tag along? Hindi mo ba alam na ginagawa mo lang syang tanga?"

"May dahilan ako kung bakit ko ginagawa yun. Eh ikaw? Bakit ka sumama sa lalaking yun?" Pagbabalik nito ng tanong sa kanya.

She sighed exasperatedly. "Eh he dragged me nga, okay? And besides, it's not as if you and I are together or anything."

"Oh yun naman pala eh."

"So ganun na lang yun? You won't do anything about it?"

Hindi ito sumagot.

"Fine! Siguro nga I was wrong na umasa sa 'yo." She stood up and started walking ng hilahin sya nito sa kamay. Napaupo sya ulit.

 

"Mahal kita." He said softly.

 

"Prove it." She pulled her hand away from him. "I'm tired of sharing Zelo. Buong buhay ko, lahat ng minahal ko palagi akong may kahati. I want to have someone for myself alone. Ayoko ng makihati. Selfish na kung selfish pero selfish ka rin kase. If you really love me, let her go. Otherwise, whatever this is we're feeling for each other... it's useless."

Pagkasabi ay agad na syang pumasok sa bahay at deretso sa kwarto nya bago pa man siya maiyak sa harap nito.

She suddenly remembered her old teddy bear. When she was ten, she received a big brown teddy bear from her lolo. Ilang araw pa lang niyang nalalaro ang teddy bear na yun ng makita ng kapatid nya, who was 4 at that time.

 

Nag-iiyak ito sa harapan ng parents nya at gustong-gustong hiramin ang teddy bear. Of course, she did not lend Dyma her toy kaya ito umiyak.

Her mom got angry with her dahil mas pinapaboran nito ang kapatid nya.

 

Mas lalo siyang nainis sa mga ito dahil hindi lang doon natapos ang pang-aagaw ng kapatid nya.

Lahat ng laruan nya ay gusto din nito. At kapag hindi nya napagbibigyan ang kapatid ay nagsusumbong ito sa mommy at daddy nya.

In the end, she had to give up all her toys to her brother para lamang hindi sya mapagalitan ng mga magulang.

 

Kahit ang paborito niyang doll house ay ginawang crime scene ng kapatid niya. Lahat ng life-sized dolls niya ay nagkapugot-pugot ang ulo at sira-sira ang mga damit. Nagkalat ang mga putol na braso at hita ng mga ito.

She gave up playing when all her toys got ruined by her brother. Bumalik sya pakikipaglaro ng chess sa lolo nya even though it bores her.

 

Pero di naglaon ay inagaw na rin ni Dyma pati ang lolo niya. When he learned how to play chess, ito na mismo ang pumupunta sa bahay ng lolo para makipaglaro.

So she stopped coming to her lolo's house and spent her time shopping instead.

 

Zelo was the first guy she fell in love with. And it made her so happy to know that he feels the same way for her. Okay na sana kaso hindi nya hinihiwalayan si Tassie. May kaagaw pa rin sya.

It's not that she doesn't feel sorry for Tassie-well, technically, she doesn't really care about her. Pero babae rin sya so she can somehow sympathize with Tassie. Kung sya man ang nasa kalagayan nito, hindi sya papayag na may kahati sya sa lalaking gusto nya.

And besides, it was selfish of Zelo to keep both girls to himself. Nagpapaasa lang sya. Ayaw nya ng pinapaasa sya so he better make his decision.

 

Nagsasawa na rin sya sa setup nila.

 

Laging patago. Minsanan pa. At may kaagaw pa sa atensiyon nito. Sino namang babae ang makakatagal sa ganoong setup? She'd rather make him choose and if he doesn't choose her... well... she'll make him choose her.

 

--

 

Kinabukasan, hindi pa rin sya kinikibo ni Zelo.

 

Fine, I guess he made his choice.

 

By lunch, Pierre invited her to have lunch with him, to which she readily agreed, much to the surprise of her friends. Pero mukha namang walang pakialam si Zelo.

He's with Tassie again.

 

The whole day passed by like a blur and before she knew it, uwian na naman. Inihatid sya ni Pierre pauwi. Inaaya pa nga sya nitong pumasyal muna but she refused.

Wala sya sa mood gumala. Isa lang naman ang gusto nyang mangyari eh. Ang malaman kung may patutunguhan pa ba ang paghihintay nya kay Zelo.

 

--

 

At around 9pm, she started to get worried kase hindi pa dumarating si Zelo. So pagkatapos kumain, lumabas sya ng bahay para hanapin ito. Sakto naman na papalabas na sya ng maliit na bakuran nila ng makasalubong niya ito.

Nakatungo ito at mukhang wala sa sarili.

"Zelo?"

 

Ewan ba niya. Hindi niya matiis ang lalaki. She wanted so bad to run to him and give him a warm embrace kaso baka makita ng mga kapitbahay.

Nakakapagod din pala... Nakakapagod isipin kung anong iisipin sayo ng ibang tao.

Tumunghay ito at sinalubong ang tingin nya. From the dim light of the nearby post, naaninag niya ang mukha nito. She noticed na namumula ang pisngi nito.

"D-Did you-"

 

Hindi pa man nya natatapos ang tanong ay tumango na ito.

 

"Totoo?" Tanong niya.

Tumango ulit ito. "Totoo."

 

For the longest time, hindi sila umaalis sa kinatatayuan nila. Pareho lang silang nakatingin sa isa't isa na para bang nagpapakiramdaman.

"Akala ko hindi mo gagawin." Sa wakas ay sabi niya.

 

"Sabi ko naman sayo di ba? Mahal kita..."

Unable to stop herself, she ran to him. Yumakap sya dito.

"Mahal din kita." Halos mangiyak-ngiyak nyang sabi.

 

Unang beses... someone chose her over someone else.

 

He patted her head saka nito hinalikan ang tuktok noon. Then he hugged her back.

"Masakit ba?" She asked, pertaining to the slap on his face.

"Oo kaya."

"Patingin nga." Ibinaling nya ang pisngi nito sa natatamaan ng ilaw. Nakita nyang halos may bakat pa ng kamay sa kaliwang pisngi nito. "She must have slapped you really hard huh?"

"Galit na galit eh." Nag-iwas ito ng tingin.

 

She tiptoed and kissed his cheek. Saka nya ikinawit ang braso sa batok nito.

"Thank you for choosing me." She whispered in his ear.

"Anytime." He kissed her hair. "Pasok na. Baka may makakita sa 'tin." Sabi nito sa kanya. Bumitaw sya rito at nagtuloy-tuloy sa kwarto nila ni Meera.

 

Little heart... ganito pala ang feeling ng first choice? Ang saya!

 

She couldn't stop smiling. Tinabihan nya ang natutulog ng si Meera at niyakap nya ito saka hinalikan sa noo. Tapos ay pumikit na sya at naghintay na dalawin ng antok.

 

"Anak..." Napamulat ulit sya ng marinig ang boses ni Manang Pacing. "Hindi naman sa tutol ako pero sana 'wag kang masyadong umasa."

 

Silence followed.

 

She anticipated on what the old woman was going to say next. Siguro ay nahalata na sila nito. Natatakot sya na baka sabihin nito sa parents nya ang nangyayari.

What if malaman nila?

 

Will they take her away from him?

 

"Hindi naman po ako umaasa." Narinig nyang sagot ni Zelo.

"Anak... habang maaga pa, pigilan mo na yang nararamdaman mo para sa kanya. Hindi ka nababagay sa isang Dirham... alam mo yan."

 

Her heart sank. Dati akala nya blessing ang maging Dirham. People do things at your will. You have control over things.

Pinagbibigyan ka parati. The mere mention of your name brings people in awe and fear and envy.

 

Pero bakit kapag Dirham ka ang tingin nila sa 'yo ay sobrang taas? Like you're some kind of god that can never be suited for a commoner.

Hindi naman mapangmata ang pamilya nya ah?

 

Bakit sila na mismo ang gumagawa ng distansya?

 

Hindi daw kami bagay, little heart? Eh di gawin nilang Nasino ang apelyido ko para bagay na kami.

 

She mentally laughed to brush that sick feeling off.

 

Xxxxx

AN: Waley ba? Haha... ewan. Pero... sa mga pro-Pierre dyan... I hate you guys. Hahaha... Zelo ako for the win! :p

*******************************************
[32] Chapter 31
*******************************************
Dont' talk about yourself too much. We will do that when you leave.

--


Dama felt free... somehow. Having Manang Pacing know about her relationship with Zelo was kind of liberating. Hindi na nila kailangang magtago ng nararamdaman nila sa isa't isa kapag nasa bahay sila.

Pero parang naging ilag na sa kanya ang matanda after that. Lalo na kapag minsan ay tinatawag nya itong nay o nanay. Meera is not a problem at all. The kid sort of wants her to be her big sister.

Mabait kase sya rito at saka siguro, the idea of two people falling in love amazes her.

 

Mahirap ding gumalaw minsan sa bahay dahil nakatingin palagi sa kanila ang matanda. Out of respect to the old lady, hindi sila nagho-holding hands sa harap nito. Lalo na kapag nasa hapag kainan dahil bigla-bigla na lang itong mawawalan ng gana.

They can be sweet... yes, pero dapat ay inilulugar pa rin.

 

They have been like that for weeks. It was the playful stage of their relationship. It's also the getting to know stage. All they did was talk and be sweet to each other.

Hindi sila nauubusan ng topic.

Hindi sila nagkakasawaan.

Marami na ring natutunan ang dalaga sa mga gawaing bahay dahil kay Zelo. Mas tumaas na rin ang grades nya. 

 

Inspired eh.

 

Totoo nga, things are easier to do when you are motivated. Ni hindi nila namalayan na tapos na pala ang isang sem ng pag-aaral. Dama wanted to commend herself. She did more than surviving. She actually lived a life she's never dreamed of living.

And to cap that off... masaya sya.

 

She was happy to be poor. Happy to eat three common meals a day. Happy to be surrounded by people that she learned to care about.

And happy to be in love with someone below her social status.

Now she finally understood her mother. Being poor isn't really that bad. You learn to value the little things. You learn to appreciate the people who appreciates you.

You learn to love the things that you never thought are worthy of your attention.

 

She loves them so much... she didn't want to go home--yet.

 

Before the official first day of a week-long sembreak, their class was given a sponsored camping. At first, hindi nya alam kung sino'ng nag-sponsor sa klase nila. But on the day of the camping itself... everything became clear to her.

Sampung malalaking bus ang nakaparada sa tapat ng school nila. 

Dirham Liners.

 


Who'd have thought?

 

And to avoid suspicion and envy among their other batchmates... lahat na ng klase within their year ay nabigyan din ng sponsored camping. Sa iba-ibang lugar.

At ang sosyal lang... kumpleto pa with the camping staffs sa pupuntahan nila.

Each class has a designated camping spot. Magkakaiba ng town.

"Grabe... ang yaman ng mga Dirham no?" She heard one classmate say.

"Oo nga eh. Kilala mo ba yang mga yan?" Tanong ng kausap nito.

Umiling ito. "Hindi eh. Naririnig ko lang minsan sa TV."

"Naririnig o nakikita?" natatawa nitong tanong.

"Nakikinig lang ako ng TV. Di ako nanunuod."

 

She smiled. Mga kaklase niya adik din eh.

 

"Hoy Dama, baka gusto mong sumakay ng bus?" Untag sa kanya ni Lei na nasa likuran nya.

"Oo na. Aakyat na. Excited much?"

 

Umakyat sya ng bus. Ngumiti sa kanya yung driver and he tapped his hat as if saluting her. She smiled back and walked on to find her seat.

Nakita nyang nakaupo si Zelo sa bandang huli, nakasandal ang ulo nito sa bintana. Mauupo sana sya doon ng bigla syang hilahin ni Eula.

"Best tabi tayo!" Sabi nito sa kanya.

Napatingin sya kay Zelo. He was already looking. She pouted at him, sad that she won't be able to sit with him. He just gave her a half-smile in return.

 

Sumalampak sya sa upuan sa tabi ni Eula.

"O bakit nakasimagot ka?" Tanong nito sa kanya.

"Wala."

 

"Hoy."

 

She looked up. Nasa tabi na ng upuan nila si Zelo.

"Bakit?" Nakasimagot nyang tanong dito.

"May plastic kang dala?" Tanong nito sa kanya.

Kumunot ang noo nya. "Wala. Bakit?"

Tumingin ito kay Eula. "Ikaw?"

Umiling ito. "Aanhin mo ba? Wag mong sabiing nagsusuka ka sa byahe?"

"Hindi ako." Sagot nito saka sya itinuro. 

 

Nagkatinginan sila ni Eula.

"Nagsusuka ka sa byahe?" 

Mabilis pa sa alas kwatro syang tumango.

"Ay ano ba! Ang tanda tanda mo na eh." Naiiling itong tumayo. "Zelo palit tayo ha? Baka masukahan  pa 'ko nyan." 

Ngumiti lang si Zelo saka sya pinausog sa tabi ng bintana. Saka ito naupo sa tabi nya.

"Para-paraan?" Mahina nyang tanong dito.

Ngumiti ito sa kanya. "Ayaw mo?"

She wrinkled her nose. "Gusto."

 

When the bus was finally filled, nagsimula na silang magbyahe. It was around 8am ng makaalis sila dahil sa dami ng late.

"Matutulog ako ha?" Sumandal sya dito.

"Yun oh... ang sweet!" Puna ni Keeme na bigla na lamang sumulpot mula sa upuan sa unahan nila.

Gumaya dito si Eli na katabi nito. "Alam nyo, kung di lang kayo magpinsan... bagay kayo." Sabi nito sa kanila.

"Thank you." Sagot niya. "Now please shut up so I can sleep."

Nagkatinginan sina Zelo at Keeme. Si Eli naman ay bumalik sa pagkakaupo nito.

 

She closed her eyes para matulog. Sanay naman syang magbyahe. Well traveled kase sya. Kaso puyat so kailangan nyang magbawi ng tulog.

And besides, she'd take advantage of this opportunity na makatulog sa balikat ni Zelo without having anyone suspect of their true intentions.

 

--

 

After 2 hours of bus ride, sa wakas ay nakarating na rin sila sa camping site. May isang malaking-malaking tent sa gitna ng damuhan at may mga taong nagluluto.

They all gathered around and waited for further announcements.

Two of the staffs asked them to group themselves into three. After it was done, binigyan sila ng mga ito ng tent. They were also asked to line up so they could be given some food to eat.

Kilala nya yung nagluluto eh. Executive chef nila sa bahay. Her dad must've sent the man para masolo nito ang kusina nila. Or maybe it was her mom who did that.

Lately kase, base sa mga text messages ng parents nya, parang nag-aagawan ito sa kusina. Parehong gustong magluto. 

 

Tuwang-tuwa ang mga kaklase niya ng makita ang pagkaing isini-serve ng cook. Steak. 

Medyo naglaway din sya ng makita ito. Kase naman, ilang buwan na rin syang pinupurga sa pagkaing pangmahirap. But at the same time, the steaks look ominous. Ewan ba niya. Siguro nga ay nasanay na rin sya sa pagkaing pangmahirap.

Or maybe the meal was more enjoyable with her new found family. Walang sigawan at bangayan... well--except nung mga first meals nya kina Zelo.

 

--

 

After some instructions from the camping staffs, pinaghanda sila ng mga ito for their hiking. At the end of the hike, may isang batis na sobrang linis ng tubig.

They'd have a picnic there.

Dama never hiked before. Excited na syang mag-hiking. And so, when they're all ready, they head off to hike. Kumpleto pa sila sa supplies ha. Lahat ay binigyan ng hiking boots na sakto ang size sa mga paa nila. Tapos may guides pa sila.

Guides... meaning marami.

 

"Di ka sanay no?" Tanong ni Zelo sa kanya when she made another stop. Nasa bandang hulihan na sila dahil uphill ang dinadaanan at nananakit na ang mga binti nya.

"Of course not! I've never done this before!" she huffed.

"Di ka man lang nag-girl scout?"

"Nag-girl scout." Sagot nya.

"Ano'ng ginawa nyo?"

"We went to France to study baking. Tapos nag-bake kami ng cookies." She said with a shrug.

"Hanep."

 

She chuckled. "I know, right? I didn't really learn anything back then. Nang-away lang ako."

"War freak ka talaga."

"Nagbabago na nga eh."

Ngumiti ito sa kanya. "So mabait ka na nang lagay na yan?"

"Tingin mo?"

Nagkibit-balikat ito.

 

He stared ahead and saw na iisa na lang ang tao. Napag-iwanan na sila nung iba. Hinawakan sya nito sa kamay at hinila sa kanan.

"S-San tayo pupunta?"

"Shortcut," sagot nito.

"Shortcut? Hoy baka maligaw tayo!"

"Tss. Relax. Alam ko 'tong lugar na 'to. Dito kami nag-camping ng boy scout dati."

"Weh?" she didn't believe him.

"Oo nga. Mas mauuna pa tayo sa kanila dun."

 

Sumunod naman sya dito. 

 

--

 

And he was right... surprisingly. Sila ang kaunahang tao na nakarating sa target place. Ang ganda ng batis. Malinaw ang tubig at saka maraming puno sa tabi. Malamig ang hangin. Presko.

He helped her remove her backpack tapos ay nagtanggal ito ng sapatos and went right at it. Nagtampisaw ito sa tubig, wetting his pants and socks.

"Hoy mapapasma ka!"

"So?" He held out his hand to her. "Halika dali!"

 

Nag-aalangan niyang tinanggal ang hiking boots at saka sya dahan-dahang lumusong sa tubig. Nagulat sya ng bigla syang hilahin nito. Napaupo sya sa tubig. Ayun.. basang-basa na tuloy sya.

"Ano ba Zelo!" Inis niyang sabi dito. Tumawa lang ito at saka sya hinila patayo. Then he pressed his hands on her cheek.

"Ang cute mo." Nakangiti nitong sabi. She blushed in an instant.

 

A blur of a moment passed and the next thing she felt was his lips on hers. Unti-unting nag-fade ang ingay ng paligid. Yung lagaslas ng tubig... yung huni ng mga ibon... yung mahinang pagaspas ng mga dahon...

And what seemed to have loudened were the sound of her heartbeat. Erratic, fast, excited heartbeat...

 

Then he abruptly ended the kiss saka ito lumayo sa kanya.

"What?" lito nyang tanong. Hindi ito nagsalita. Bagkus ay umahon ito mula sa batis at naupo sa malaking bato na malapit sa kanila.

Maya'maya'y narinig nya ang boses ng mga taong paparating.

 

"Oh?! Kanina lang nasa hulihan kayo ah?" Gulat na tanong ni Eli sa dalawa.

"Lumipad kami," pabirong sagot ni Zelo.

"Bat basa na kayo? Excited maligo?" tanong naman ni Lei.

"Eh sa mainit bakit ba?" sagot dito ng binata.

"Eh bat ang sungit mo?" Lei retorted.

"Mainit kase," siya ang sumagot dito. "Yaan nyo na. Tara swimming tayo?" aya nya sa mga kaibigan.

 

--

 

All in all, enjoy naman ang camping nila. When night came, they all gathered around this huge bonfire tapos kanya-kanya silang ihaw ng isda. Nagkwentuhan pa sila habang kumakain. Kanya-kanyang grupo...

Syempre silang magbabarkada ang magkakasama.

Dama ate her fish on a stick while looking around. It so happened that when she looked across, a certain girl from her class was already staring at her.

Si Megumi... or Meg as she's commonly known. Masama ang tingin nito sa kanya. Or maybe kay Zelo? She couldn't tell kase magkatabi silang dalawa ng lalaki.

"Zelo, masama na naman ang tingin sa 'yo ni Meg," puna ni Lei.

"Hmm?" Zelo looked across the field. Nang makita ng babaeng nakatingin ito sa kanya ay dali-dali itong nag-iwas ng tingin.

"Problema nya?" tanong ni Dama.

"Hindi pa rin kase nya matanggap na binreak ni Zelo si Tassie. Affected much, akala mo sa kanya nakipag-break."

 

She remembered na best friend nga pala ni Meg si Tassie. In fact, nagkakilala nga daw sina Zelo at Tassie through Meg.

 

"Di ba may gusto sa 'yo dati yan Zelo?" tanong ni Eli sa binata. Napatingin sya kay Zelo.

Tumawa lang ito. "Aba ewan," sagot nito.

"Meron nga," sabat naman ni Eula. "Umiyak nga yun nung naging sila ni Tassie eh. Tanga kase, may gusto kay Zelo tapos nag-presintang maging tulay."

Kumunot ang noo nya. "Bakit ang daming nagkakagusto sa 'yo?" tanong niya dito.

"Eh kase gwapo ako," nakangiti nitong sagot.

 

Umirap sya sa binata at binalikan ng tingin si Meg. Nakatingin na naman ito sa kanila.

"Wag mo nang pansinin," untag sa kanya ni Zelo.

Sumunod naman sya at nag-focus na lang sa pagkain ng hapunan nya.

 

After that, all were asked to sleep at exactly 11PM para makauwi sila ng maaga kinabukasan.

Second semester....

 

First day of second semester... maagang pumasok ang dalawa para salubungin ang bagong sem ng pag-aaral. At syempre, excited na rin silang makitang muli ang barkada.

Pero nagulat sila nang salubungin sila ng mapang-akusang mata ng mga estudyante. Nagtaka ang dalawa. Bagong pasok pa lang tapos may kaaway na sila agad?

She didn't like the feeling.

"Well well well... if it's not the incestuous cousins," si Tassie, kasama si Meg at iba pa nitong kabarkada.

"Hi Tassie," she smiled at the girl. "Kung bitter ka pa rin sa break up nyo ng pinsan ko, pwede bang 'wag mo akong idamay?" Mahinahon nyang sabi dito.

Tass scoffed. "Really? Magde-deny ka pa eh nagkalat na yung picture nyo na naghahalikan sa Facebook?"

Nagulat ang dalawa sa narinig.

Tassie continued. "So kaya pala ang bilis mong makipag-break Zelo? Sarili mo palang pinsan ang lumalandi sa 'yo."

Dama clenched her fist in fury. "Stop making accusations please." She tried to make her voice as calm as possible.

"I'm not accusing you dear. Nagsasabi lang ako ng totoo. Tingin nyo ba maitatago nyo pa sa 'min yun?" Tassie took out her phone. "Look. Kayo 'to di ba? Di ba?!"

 

Halos mawalan ng kulay ang mukha ng dalaga ng makita nito yung picture na nasa cellphone ni Tassie. Naka-zoom ang pagkakakuha kaya medyo malabo. The girl could not be mistaken for anyone else dahil sya lang ang bukod tanging naka-ribbon ng red noon. She was facing the camera. Zelo had his back on it.

"Ano? Hindi ka na makapagsalita dyan!"

"I-It's not what you think!" pagtanggi niya.

"Tanga lang ang hindi maniniwalang kayo yan. Huling-huli na kayo!" Tumingin ito kay Zelo. "At ikaw! I was expecting a lot more from you. Dean's lister ka pa naman! Akala mo santo sa bait, nasa loob din pala ang baho mo!"

 

Dama wanted to cry. She wanted to run away. She wanted to hide. But she couldn't move. She was too overwhelmed.

 

"Yo!" Naramdaman ng dalagang may umakbay sa kanya. She looked up to her right and saw the smiling face of Pierre.

"P-Pierre!"

Pierre diverted his gaze to Tassie's phone. "Oh? Nakunan nyo pala 'to?"

Kumunot ang noo nina Tassie.

"Nakakahiya!" Napakamot sa ulo ang binata. Saka sya nito pinisil sa pisngi.  "Ikaw kase, ang cute cute mo. Di tuloy kita napigilang i-kiss!"

Napamaang si Dama sa narinig. Si Tassie naman ay tiningnan ng masama si Meg.

"Akala ko ba si Zelo to?" tanong nito sa kasama.

"Si Zelo yan!" mariing sabi ni Meg. "Wala naman si Pierre dun eh!"

"Well that's because you're not supposed to know I'm there," sagot naman ng binata. "Pero syempre, hahayaan ko bang magpunta kung saan ng mag-isa ang girlfriend ko?"

 

"GIRLFRIEND?!" halos ay sabay-sabay nilang sabi.

 

Tumawa si Pierre. "Oo girlfriend. Bakit gulat na gulat kayo?"

"Pero si Zelo ang kasama ni Dama pagpunta dun!" 

"Inihatid ko lang sya," pagtanggi naman ni Zelo. "Sasalubungin kami ni Pierre kaya umiba kami ng daan."

"Eh bat kayo lang yung naabutan namin dun?!" Meg got angry. Nagmumukha kase syang tanga.

"Alangan namang magpahuli ako? Eh di sinita ako!" sagot ni Pierre.

 

Tassie sighed in defeat. "This is stupid!"

"Tassie wait!" habol ni Meg sa kaibigan ng mag-walk out ito. Naiwan silang tatlo na nakatayo sa may entrance ng gate.

 

"Thank you," bulong niya kay Pierre.

"Ano'ng thank you? Oy may kapalit yun!" Natatawa nitong sabi.

"Ano?" they both asked.

 

 

"Magiging girlfriend kita for real."

"Sasabihin ko sa kanilang pinilit lang kita."

 

Nakatungo ang dalaga habang naglalakad. Her friends agreed to meet up with them after class. Medyo gabi na ang uwi nila so they decided na pagkatapos ng klase sila mag-uusap-usap.

Madilim na.... halos wala ng tao. It's almost seven in the evening na rin kase...

She waited for him to say something pero nanatili lamang itong tahimik.

 

Buong maghapon silang magkalayo. Buong hapon silang hindi nag-imikan. Ni pagtingin dito ay iniwasan nya para walang masabi ang mga tao sa paligid nila. Si Pierre ang kadikit nya maghapon.

Ito yung malayang nakakahawak sa kamay nya o nakakaakbay sa kanya sa harap ng maraming tao.

 

Girlfriend... 

 

Ngayong naging ganito na sya... parang gusto nyang maiyak. Bakit sa taong hindi pa nya gusto sya magkakaroon ng relasyon?

Nandito na sa tabi nya yung taong gusto nya pero bakit hindi pwedeng maging sila?

She sighed as they entered the room at the end of the hall. May mga upuan na nakaikot. Nakaupo doon sina Lei, Eula, Eli at Keeme. May dalawang bakanteng upuan na she's guessing ay para sa kanila.

Matamang nakatingin sa kanila ang apat, nasa may pintuan pa lang sila.

 

She gave them her sheepish smile saka sya naupo sa tabi ni Lei. Naupo din si Zelo sa tabi nya.

"Ano 'to? Council meeting? Bat ang seseryoso nyo?" she joked.

Tumingin sa kanya ang apat.

"Galing ah... parang wala lang nangyari," Lei finally said.

 

Natahimik sya.

 

"Magtapat nga kayo sa 'min... may relasyon ba kayong dalawa?" mataray na tanong ni Eula. Mukhang kaiiyak lang nito.

"W-Wala nga!" mariin nyang tanggi. "I was the one who kissed him. Ako lang yung mapilit. Ayaw nya pero pinilit ko sya. Di ba?" she nudged Zelo.

 

Kagaya ng napag-usapan natin... I'll carry the mess I created by myself. Ayaw na kitang idamay. Please... sakyan mo na lang ang sinasabi ko.

 

"Huy!" untag nyang muli dito. "Sumagot ka naman!"

"Ano Zelo? Totoo ba?" tanong ni Eli.

Nakita niyang saglit na nagkatinginan sina Keeme at Zelo. Zelo held her hand after. Pilit nya iyong binabawi pero ayaw nitong bumitaw.

Saka nito pinadaanan ng tingin ang barkada.

 

"Ayan." he raised their intertwined hands. "Yan ang totoo."

 

Ilang minuto ang lumipas ng walang nagsasalita sa kanila. Nagkakatinginan silang magkakaibigan. Titingin sa dalawa, maiiling, magkakatinginan at titingin ulit sa kanila.

"Ano na namang kalokohan 'to ha?" naiinis na tanong ni Lei.

"Gusto nyo ng totoo? Eto ang totoo," sagot ni Zelo.

Dama tried pulling her hand from him pero hindi ito bumitaw.

"Z-Zelo..."

Sa wakas ay tumingin na rin ito sa kanya. "What's the point kung itatago pa natin sa kanila, di ba?" Ngumiti ito. "Mahal kita... hindi ko yun dapat itago sa mga kaibigan ko."

She immediately turned red.

 

"What the fuck Zelo! Magpinsan kayo di ba?!" paghuhuramentado ni Lei.

"Oo nga! Alam nyo bang kasalanan sa Diyos yan?" mangiyak-ngiyak na tanong ni Eula.

 

"Hindi naman sila magpinsan eh," sagot ni Keeme sa magkapatid. Gulat na napalingon ang mga ito dito.

"Ano?"

"Pakiulit?"

"Hindi sila magpinsan," pag-uulit nito.

"May ganyan ka na palang nalalaman, hindi mo man lang sinasabi sa 'min?" Lei said in anger. "Pare-pareho nyo kaming pinagmumukhang tanga. Alam nyo yun? Hindi namin kayo maipagtanggol kase alam namin na kayo yun eh!"

"Sorry na Lei," mangiyak-ngiyak niyang sabi sa kaibigan. "Sorry na... hindi naman kase namin akalan na may makakakita eh."

"At hanggang kelan nyo balak itago sa 'min ha? Kung hindi pa kayo huhulihin, di kayo aamin eh!"

 "Sorry na kase!" natuluyan na sa pag-iyak si Dama. 

 

"Wag kang umiyak tanga! Naiinis lang ako sayo. Kung sana sinabi nyo agad sa 'min eh di naipagtanggol ko kayo sa bruhang Tassie na yun!"

Yumakap si Lei sa kanya. Sumunod na rin si Eula.

"Oo nga! Ang bitter nya masyado! Akala mo santa sa bait, magaling lang palang magtago ng sungay!" dagdag nito.

 

Puro luha man sa pisngi ay napangiti ang dalaga at gumanti ng yakap sa magkapatid.

"Group hug!!!" Eli announced saka yumakap sa tatlo. 

"Adik!" Itinulak ito ni Eula at saka sila tuluyang naghiwa-hiwalay.

 

"So pano yan? Kayo na ni Pierre di ba?" 

 

"Bakit mo kase pinabayaan Zelo?"

"Tingin nyo ba gusto ko yun?" inis na sagot ng binata. 

"Naaawa na ako sa inyo best," nakasimangot na sabi sa kanya ni Eula. "Matagal na ba kayo?"

"Ilang months pa lang," sagot niya habang nagpapahid ng luha.

"Kaya pala minsan, parang iba yung tingin nyo sa isa't isa eh. Hindi ko na lang binibigyan ng malisya kase akala ko ganun lang talaga kayo," Eli shared.

"So ano'ng plano nyong dalawa?" tanong ni Keeme sa kanila.

 

"Siguro hahayaan na muna naming mamatay yung issue na ginawa ni Tassie," sagot dito ni Zelo.

"Handa kang ipaubaya si Dama sa iba habang inaantay nyo yun?" pabalik nitong tanong.

"Hindi ko naman sya ipapaubaya eh," tumingin si Zelo sa kanya. No--stare is more like it. "Sa 'kin ka lang di ba?"

Kiilig ang barkada sa sinabi nito. Napangiti naman siya.

 

"Hoy Zelo gumaganyan ka na ha! Dati lang hindi ka tumitingin sa mga babae!"

 

Nagtawanan sila. 

 

"Oy Keeme... since naman na nagladlad na kami.... baka gusto mong sumunod?" Dama grinned at Keeme. Biglang nawala ang ngiti nito at umiwas ng tingin.

"Ano'ng aaminin ni Keeme? Hoy! Wag mong sabihing may nahalikan ka rin?" tanong ni Lei. Nagkatinginan sina Dama, Eula, Zelo at Eli.

"Keeme amin na!" pagpilit nila dito.

"Wala naman akong aaminin eh!" 

"Sus! Dali na!" 

"Aamin na yan!"

"Wala nga!"

"Dali na! Aminin mo na kase kay Lei!"

 

Eula glared at Eli. Nadala kase ito sa moment kaya ayun... nadulas.

"Oops!"

 

Nagkatinginan sina Lei at Keeme. Kumunot ang noo ng dalaga.

"Aamining ano?" tanong nito sa binata. "Hoy Keeme Jace Astel, ano na namang kalokohan 'to?"

"Aba malay ko!"

 

"Eeee... dali na Keeme! Amin na kase!" pagpipilit ng mga kabarkada nila.

 

Nagdabog ito. "Wala nga kase akong aaminin sa kanya! Wala naman akong gusto sa kanya eh! Ang kulit nyo lang!" naiirita nitong sabi.

 

Natahimik sila bigla.

 

 

 

 

 

"Si Eula ang gusto ko, maliwanag?" Pagkasabi'y lumabas ito ng classroom at iniwan sila.

 

xxxxxx

AN: So... maikli ang UD. Antok na antok na eh... saka distracted. Ang dami kaseng maingay kanina. haha... anyway, sana magustuhan nyo. ^^

I'm sorry you don't like my honesty. But to be fair... I don't like your lies either.




--





Pagkatapos mag-walk out ni Keeme, sumunod naman si Lei. Naiwan sina Dama sa classroom na hulog ang panga. Eula slumped back to her chair--unable to think clearly.

"Euls okay ka lang?" nag-aalalang tanong niya rito. Wala nang kulay ang mukha nito sa sobrang pagkabigla.

"Grabe... akala ko talaga si Lei..." naiiling na sambit ni Eli.

 

Biglang napasabunot sa sariling buhok si Eula. "Ano ba! Sumasakit ang ulo ko! Ang daming revelations ngayong araw! Kakaloka!"

"Oo nga eh," pag sang-ayon ni Eli. "Uy umuwi na tayo. Gabi na oh."

"Tara?" pag-aaya ni Dama kay Zelo.

Tumingin naman ito kay Eula. "Ihahatid ka na namin."

"Ano ba... hindi na 'ko bata no. Kaya kong umuwing mag-isa," pagtanggi nito.

"Lutang ka kaya," Dama said to her.

"Hello! Ikaw ba naman ang makaalam na yung best friend mo at yung friend mo for 3 years na akala mo'y magpinsan eh hindi pala! Tapos may relasyon pa kayong dalawa! And then dumagdag pa si Keeme na akala ko may gusto sa ate ko tapos... sa 'kin pala! Sino'ng hindi mawiwindang dun?"

"Oh... kalma ka lang," hinagod-hagod niya ang likod nito.

Nag-alboroto na naman ito. "Kase! Nakakainis! Naiinis ako sa inyo!" Pagkasabi'y hinablot nito ang bag at saka umalis ng classroom.

Naiwan silang tatlo doon na mga naiiling.

 

"Ang gulo ng araw na 'to," kumento ni Eli.

 

"Sinabi mo pa," pagsang-ayon niya. "Umuwi na nga lang tayo." Tumayo siya at agad namang sumunod ang dalawang lalaki. Inayos nila ang mga upuan at isinarado ang classroom bago sila umuwi.

 

--

 

Naglalakad sila sa daan pauwi ng mabaling ang atensiyon ni Dama kay Eli.

"Ikaw Eli... wala ka bang aaminin?"

Ngumuso ito. "Ano naman ang aaminin ko?"

She shrugged. "Ewan... may aaminin ka ba?"

"Psh. Wala!"

"Weh?" she wiggled her eyebrows at him. Itinulak naman nito ang mukha nya palayo.

"Pwede ba? Di porket uso ang mag-aminan ngayon eh dapat may aaminin na rin ako."

"Oo nga naman," pagsang-ayon ni Zelo sa kaibigan.

Dama pouted at the two. "KJ."

 

Inakbayan sya ni Zelo saka pinisil nito ang pisngi niya. "Wag mo kaseng kulitin. Aamin naman yan kapag may aaminin na sya eh, di ba Eli?" tanong nito sa kaibigan.

"Psh. Oo na. Pero nagulat talaga ako kanina... akala ko si Lei. Sabi nyo si Lei? Tapos si Eula naman pala."

Eli shrugged. "Di rin kase namin alam."

"So nag-conclude lang kayo ganun?"

"Eh kase akala namin ganun nga. Yun kase yung nabasa namin sa kinikilos nya." Si Zelo ang sumagot.

"So hindi naman nya sinabi sa inyo directly na si Lei ang gusto nya?" she asked.

"Hindi," sabay na sagot ng dalawa.

"Ang fail nyo!" Sumimangot ang dalaga. "Kumusta na kaya si Eula?"

 

--

 

Problemadong-problemado si Eula pagkauwi nang bahay. Hindi sya kinakausap ng ate nya... na para bang kasalanan pa niyang sa kanya nagkagusto si Keeme.

Hindi nga niya maintindihan ang ate nya. May gusto ba ito sa kaibigan nila at ganun na lamang ang inis nito sa kanya?

Pilit syang tinatanong ng mama nila kung ano ba ang problema nilang magkapatid at hindi sila nagpapansinan pero wala syang maisagot. Dahil hindi rin nya alam.

Ayaw nyang nag-aaway o nagkakatampuhan silang magkapatid.

 

Mahirap kaseng magkaroon ng kapatid na babae na halos kasing tanda mo. Mag-kaagaw kayo sa karamihan nang bagay. Mapa-damit, alahas, sapatos... buti nga hindi pa dumadating sa point na nagkagusto sila sa isang lalaki eh.

Eto nga lang ang problema nila ngayon... lalaki.

 

Bakit ba kase kailangan pa syang gustuhin ni Keeme? Ayos na sana eh. She likes Jairus, na alam naman nyang malabong magustuhan ng ate nya dahil pandak ito. And Keeme should like Lei dahil bagay sila.

Pero siguro hindi lahat nang bagay ay dapat nagkakapareha. O mas madali ba'ng sabihin na hindi lahat na gusto niya ay pwedeng mangyari?

 

Eto nga't yung taong gustong-gusto nya, textmate lang ang tingin sa kanya. Ni hindi pa umabot sa kaibigan. But she'll take it... kesa naman habang gusto nya ito ay mula sa malayo na lang niya ito matitingnan.

At least now, he acknowledge her presence. At least, he knows that she exists...

 

And with him in her mind... she composed a message for him alone.

 

To: Jairus <3

Busy? Pede paabala? Just want to share something. :(

 

She waited for his reply. Medyo nainis pa nga sya kase nakakailang minuto na eh wala pa rin iyon. Pero ano pa nga bang magagawa nya? Hindi naman sya ang girlfriend. Ni hindi nga sila magkaibigan sa personal.

Nagbihis muna sya at naghilamos bago muling bumalik sa kama at i-check ang phone nya.

Sumilay ang ngiti niya nang makitang may reply na si Jairus.

 

From: Jairus <3

?

 

Napasimangot sya, Sa haba nang tinext nya dito ay question mark lamang ang reply? But she ignored her annnoyance. At least naman nag-reply ito di ba? Effort din yun.

 

To: Jairus <3

Sorry. Nakakaabala ba ko?

 

From: Jairus <3

Di naman po. Ano prob mo?

 

She sighed. Tama ba'ng dito nya sabihin ang problema nya? 

 

To: Jairus <3

Pano kapag may umamin sayo na friend mo na gusto ka nya, anong gagawin mo?

 

From: Jairus <3

Bakit? May gusto ka ba sakin? Haha. ^_^v

 

Biglang kumabog ang dibdib ng dalaga sa nabasa. Hindi nya alam kung alam ba nitong may gusto sya dito o talagang nagbibiro lang? She decided to play along.

 

To: Jairus <3

At kung meron? Hahaha.





From: Jairus <3

:p




"Ano kaya yun? Di man lang sinagot. Tss."

 

To: Jairus <3

Joke lang po. Ano kase, nagtapat sakin yung friend ko eh. Indirectly nga lang.

 

From: Jairus <3

Eh di mabuti. Bakit ayaw mo?

 

To: Jairus <3

Hindi ko naman kase sya gusto eh.




From: Jairus <3

Awts. Friendzoned. :(




 "Hindi mo kase naiintindihan eh," naiinis nyang sabi.

 

To: Jairus <3

May iba na kase akong gusto.




From: Jairus <3

Sino? Pede malaman? ;)





"Ikaw engot. Ang cute cute mo kase nakakainis ka..."

 

To: Jairus <3

Secret. :p




From: Jairus <3

Wala. Madaya. Akala ko ba friends tayo? :(




"So friends na tayo? Okay." Napangiti ang dalaga. Kahit hindi taos sa puso ang sinabi nito eh... wala lang... parang nakakatuwa. At least she's one step closer. From being wala lang to becoming a textmate. Ngayon naman ay friends na daw sila kuno.

Bukas-bukas kaya eh maging M.U. naman sila?

 

To: Jairus <3

Weh? Friends na tayo? Haha... kahit na. Sikreto pa rin. :p

 

--

 

Ilang minuto na ang nakakalipas ay hindi pa rin nagre-reply si Jairus. Muling nag-type ng message si Eula.

 

To: Jairus <3

Uy... galit ka po? :(





Hindi pa rin ito nag-reply.

Sa mga sumunod na araw, nagka-watak-watak ang barkada. Si Keeme ay palaging mag-isa. Magkasama naman sina Eli at Zelo. Si Dama--ayun, ayaw tigilan ni Pierre.

Sina Eula at Lei nag-iiwasan pa rin...

"Ano ba! 'Wag ka ngang umakbay!" Iritadong sabi ni Dama nang bigla siyang akbayan ni Pierre.

Kinabig naman sya nito kaya napasubsob sya sa dibdib nito. "No choice ka girlfriend," natatawa nitong sabi.

"I hate you!" paasik niyang sabi dito.

"Sus! Halikan kita dyan eh."

"Subukan mo lang at tingnan natin kung may mukha ka pang ihaharap sa school bukas!" pagbabanta niya rito.

"Pakipot pa eh..."

"Tss. Ang presko mo rin eh noh? Kainis!"

"Kahit na mainis ka sa 'kin, girlfriend pa rin kita. Kahit ipagtabuyan mo 'ko, girlfriend pa rin kita. Kaya umayos ka... kase girlfriend kita. Okay?" Seryoso ang tono nito na para bang nambabanta. Kaya kahit nakangiti ito ay hindi magawang maging at ease ni Dama.

 

"Uuwi na 'ko," simple niyang sabi dito.

"Wala pang 5PM. Di ba usapan natin, 5 onwards ka pa lang pwedeng umuwi?"

"Susme naman! It's 8 minutes before 5... can't I just go?" She rolled her eyes at him.

"Eight minutes na lang pala eh, bat di mo pa maintay?" pabalik nitong tanong sa kanya.

She just grunted and waited for the long eight minutes before five. Wala rin naman syang magagawa eh. Mabuti nga't hindi sya nito pini-pwersang gawin yung mga bagay na talagang ayaw nya--like uh... kissing him.

 

--

 

At five o'clock sharp, inihatid na siya ni Pierre pauwi. On their way to the gate, hinarang sila ng grupo ni Tassie.

"Do you really have to pose in the middle of the pathway?" mataray nyang tanong dito.

Tassie crossed her arms. "Hoy malanding babae, 'wag kang magpakampante okay? Minamanmanan ko ang bawat kilos mo kaya mag-ingat-ingat ka," banta nito sa kanya.

Tumingin sya sa sahig na malapit sa kaliwang paa nito.

"Uy nalaglag yata yung halo mo oh... pakipulot. Next time kase, itali mo sa sungay mo ng hindi nalalaglag."

"Kung meron mang may sungay sa 'ting dalawa, ikaw yun!" nang-gagalaiti nitong sabi sa kanya.

Nagtaas siya ng kilay. "Bakit? Itinatanggi ko ba?" Nilingon nya si Pierre at kinapitan sa braso. "Halika na nga boyfriend. Nakakahiya naman sa mga pa-santa dito."

 

Nag-excuse si Pierre sa mga babaeng nakaharang at saka sila dumaan ni Dama. But before going out the gate, nilingon ni Dama si Tassie.

"Hey Tass!" she called.

"What?!"

"Ang bitter , uri nang lasa. 'Wag mong inuugali. Sayang ang ganda kung wala ka namang class. Ta!" she waved at Tassie while smiling widely. Pang-asar lang.

 

--

 

Pag-uwi niya sa bahay, agad niyang hinanap si Zelo. Umuwi na rin ito nung umuwi na sila ni Pierre. Hindi nga lang ito nakisabay. Kanina pa ito nakatingin sa kanila... 

Nang hindi mahanap ang lalaki sa loob ay nagpunta siya sa likod-bahay.

Nakaupo lang ito. Naka-de-kwatro at nakatingala sa puno ng guyabano na nasa tapat nito.

"Hoy," tawag niya.

Lumingon ito. His stare, bland. "Hoy ka rin."

Tinabihan nya ito. "Galit ka?"

"Hindi." Umakbay ito sa kanya. Akbay na naging yakap. "Nagseselos lang."

"Ano ka ba... 'wag kang magselos. Wala akong gusto dun," she assured him.

"Naiinggit kase ako sa kanya. Nayayakap ka nya in public. Nahahawakan nya yung kamay mo sa harap nang marami. Samantalang ako..."

She touched his cheek. "Don't worry, okay? Nasa 'yo na naman si little heart eh." She smiled.

"Eh bakit ka nagpapahalik sa kanya?"

"Correction--sya ang humahalik. Di ko naman gusto."

 

Pinisil nito ang pisngi niya. Then he traced her lips with his thumb.

"Basta 'wag dito ha?" sabi nito.

"Oo naman."

"Good." He kissed her.

 

xxxxx

AN: Sorry matagal-tagal ang UD. Operation tulog maaga eh. Hahaha... ayan. Hope you enjoy. ^^

"They won't find me here. I'm safe!" Paulit-ulit na sabi ng dalaga sa sarili habang nagtatago sya sa isang kahon ng sapatos sa gitna ng malawak na parang.

She saw people pass her by and she slouched even more to hide her head that was peeking out of the box. One faceless person stopped in front of her.

She cringed as the man she couldn't recognize leered at her from above.

She saw his menacing smile and she covered her face, convinced that if she can't see him, he would go away.

But she couldn't stop herself from peeking through the gaps between her fingers.

"I knew it," says the man with a female voice. "Go home princess."

Binagsakan sya nito ng kung anu-anog mga bagay that she later recognized as her old bags, shoes and clothes.

She tried to throw them out of the box but they were to heavy. And she was so tiny.

She started crying as many people gather around the box.

One of them reached out her hand to her.

"Come on sweetie... it's time to go home."

"NO!" she screamed at her. She held on to the cardboard wall as the woman picked up the box and tried to grab her.

Then she felt someone push her from behind and she slumped to the woman's hand.

She struggled to get free from the woman's clutch pero inihaya nito sa kanya ang isang cleaver.

"We'll go home now," the woman said with finality.

"NO! Please! I want to stay!" she begged as tears streamed down her face.

 

She felt a familiar hand on her shoulder. When she turned around, it was a faceless guy. Pero alam nyang si Zelo ito.

He started to shake her shoulders.

 

Then she woke up.

 

"Binabangungot ka na naman," bungad ni Zelo sa kanya.

She wiped her tears, sat up and embraced him. "I-I'm scared," mangiyak-ngiyak nyang sabi dito.

"Shhh. Nandito lang ako," pag-aalo nito sa kanya.

Isiniksik niya ang mukha niya sa may leeg nito. "I don't want to go home."

He brushed her hair and kissed it. "Wala tayong magagawa. Kailangan mong umuwi."

She pushed him slightly away and then she pouted. "Ayoko."

Ngumiti ito sa kanya. "Alam mo bumangon ka na lang."

"Umaga na ba?" tanong niya rito.

Tumango ito. "Naliligo na si Meera. Sumunod ka na." He tried to unwrap her arms from him but she didn't budge.

"Kapag ba bumalik na sa dati ang lahat, will we stay together?" tanong niya rito.

"Oo naman," he assured her.

"Promise?"

He smiled and kissed her on the forehead. "Pangako."

 

--

 

Dama has this sick feeling since this morning. Nagsimula iyon when she tried approaching Manang Pacing to help her at the kitchen at hindi sya pinansin nito.

Ngayong break time, she felt grave.

Like something was going to happen. Something horrible.

 

"Well well well. Look who we have here."

She rolled her eyes as Tassie and her friends gathered around her.

"What do you want?"

Tassie smiled sweetly at her. "I just want to give you back your crown," sabi nito. She saw Meg give Tassie a cardboard that was shaped to look like a crown. "Princess."

"No thank you. I like my horns better," sagot niya.

"No no no," pagtanggi nito. "I think this will suit you better. Kase hindi ka lang bitch, sinungaling ka pa. Inako mo talaga lahat noh?"

She sighed. "Look. If this is about Zelo again... please lang. 'Wag mo 'kong idamay sa pagiging bitter mo. it's not my fault na hindi ka nya matagalan."

 

Tassie threw the crown on her lap. "Megumi, ang magazine," utos nito sa kabarkada.

Kumabog ang dibdib ng dalaga nang makita ang magazine na iniabot ni Megumi kay Tassie. It's a copy of Marie Claire magazine... the one where she was featured.

Binuklat ni Tassie ang magazine at itinambad sa kanya ang centerfold. Yep, she made it there. She was the model for Gucci. From head to toe, she was clad in Gucci everything. 

And she looked mean.

"Hmm... maybe I should have smiled," she commented.

Sa inis, inihampas ni Tassie ang magazine sa mukha ni Dama. Nang-gagalaiti ito sa galit.

"Siguro kaya ipinagpalit ako ni Zelo sa 'yo eh dahil mayaman ka! Sabagay nga naman, hindi ko naman sya masisisi. Nakakahiya naman kase sa kanya. Mukhang pera!"

Dama clenched her fists to prevent herself from knocking the daylights out of Tassie. Don't fight. Don't fight. Don't fight. Paulit-ulit niyang sinasabi sa sarili. 

"Ano? Di ka makatanggi noh? Face it princess, hindi ka nababagay dito!"

 

"Hoy inggeterang gold fish, bakit mo inaaway ang best friend ko ha?"

 

Napamura ng mahina si Dama ng marinig ang boses ni Eula. Nakita niyang pumagitna ito sa kanilang dalawa ni Tassie.

"Best friend?" Tassie raised an eyebrow. And then she looked straight to Dama. "Alam ba ng best friend mo kung sino kang talaga?"

Eula looked at them--confused.

"I think not," dagdag ni Tassie.

"Best, ano ba'ng pinagsasasabi ng mahaderang babae na yan ha?" untag nito sa kanya.

Nanatiling tikom ang bibig ng dalaga. Nangingilid na ang mga luha niya but she continued to resist the need to cry. Maybe this is bound to happen. Oo na. Alam naman nyang darating din silang lahat sa puntong ito.

She just didn't expect it to be this early.

 

Pero marami namang bagay na hindi niya inaasahang mangyayari ang nangyari na eh.

She made some friends.

She learned to accept people.

She began to care.

She fell in love.

 

Ang sakit lang na parang bigla-bigla na lang matatapos ang lahat kung kelan gusto na nya ng ganitong buhay.

 

"Since your best friend can't talk, ako na lang ang magkikwento sa 'yo." Ipinakita ni Tassie ang picture ni Dama sa magazine. Saka nito itinuro ang article na nasa gilid ng picture.

Nanlaki ang mga mata ni Eula nang makita ang mga katagang heiress to a multi-billion dollar business empire.


"Dirham?" nalilitong tanong ni Eula.

Tumango si Tassie. "Alam mo bang may-ari ng ilang mall chain, bus lines, commercial and manufacturing company, perfume and fashion line, hotels and resorts--to name a few--yang best friend mo? Oh, right. I bet she didn't tell you. Kase nga naman, baka hingan nyo lang sya ng pera."

"That's not true!" sa wakas ay nasabi ng dalaga.

"Tingin nyo ba talaga kaibigan ang tingin nya sa inyo? Girl, wake up! Laruan ka lang nya! Yung mga katulad nya, hindi nakikipagkaibigan sa mga tulad mo!" dugtong pa nito.

"Shut up!"

"Totoo ba lahat ng yun?" Eula asked. Umiiyak na ito ng humarap sa kanya.

"Eula..." Pano pa nya itatanggi? Kahit hindi lahat ng yun ay totoo.... she still lied. 

"I hate you!" 

 

Patakbong umalis si Eula.

 

She followed her best friend with a helpless gaze. Nakita nya itong lumapit kina Eli at Keeme. And then they all looked back at her. She let her gaze wander somewhere else, hoping that she'll see Zelo.

Pero wala ito. Hindi nya mahagilap.

 

Pero may iba syang nakita. A familiar face. She ran towards him bago pa man ito makalabas ng gate.

"Pierre!"

Nilingon sya nito at ngumiti. "Uy."

"Help me," she begged of him.

"I'm sorry. I can't do that anymore. Tapos na daw ang obligasyon ko dito," sagot nito sa kanya.

"W-What?"

"I was sent here to help you. At ngayon na uuwi ka na, she said I could go home already."

Kumunot ang noo ng dalaga. "Did my mom send you?" tanong niya dito.

"No. Author did."

"Who?"

Umiling ito. "Never mind. Anyway, here's my calling card. If ever you still want to hang out after all these." Nagsimula itong maglakad palayo.

"Wait! Pierre!"

He stopped, looked back at her and smiled. "By the way... it's Oliver." He gave her a final wave saka ito tuluyang lumabas ng gate.

 

Nanlumo ang dalaga. Now she really has no one to turn to. She looked back at Tassie's group. Nakangiti ang mga ito sa kanya.

"Miss?"

She turned around to see who called. Nakita niya ang tatlong katulong na madalas nyang kasama sa school. Kasama pa yung dalawa nyang bodyguards.

She sighed as she looked up the sky. "This is so not happening," she muttered.

The five escorted her out of the school, pasakay sa kotse. She had to bear the eyes of the students and teachers alike. Na para bang pinatawan sya ng death sentence.

When she was finally inside the car, she breathed out a sigh of relief. Nang sinimulan ng paandarin ang kotse, she spoke again.

"Wait. I need to go back to that house."

Tumango agad ang driver at dinala sila sa bahay ng mga Nasino.

 

She immediately got out of the car and looked for them. Ngunit nabigo sya. Walang tao sa bahay. Wala na rin ang mga gamit nila.

Napasalampak sa sahig ang dalaga at biglang nag-iiyak. 

"Miss..." Lumuhod si Telma sa tabi niya at nag-aalangang hinagod ang likod niya.

"Telma!" Yumakap sya dito. "Where are they? Where's Zelo?"

"Miss tahan na po. Kailangan nyo ng umuwi."

"But I don't want to go home!"

"Ganun naman talaga ang buhay eh. Hindi lahat ng gusto natin ay nasusunod," nakangiti nitong sabi sa kanya. "Wag kang mag-alala. Magiging ayos din ang lahat."

 

--

 

Pagkadating ng bahay ay agad na pumunta ng kwarto ang dalaga para magkulong. She skipped lunch and dinner and went right to sleep. Alalang-alala na ang mag-asawa sa kanya. 

When morning came at nasa hapag kainan na ang tatlo, ipinatawag na ni Meg si Dama sa katulong para kumain. But the maid came back with no one.

Sighing, Meg stood up and went to her daughter's room.

"Sweetie?" she called out.

"Go away!" came a throaty reply.

"Please open the door," pakiusap nya sa anak.

"I'm tired. Leave me alone!"

 

Tinawag ni Meg ang isang katulong at inutusang kunin ang master key. When the maid came back, binuksan nito ang pintuan.

Nakita niyang nagtalukbong ng kumot ang anak.

"Anak... you have to eat."

"No. Just let me die," sagot nito.

"Come on. You're over-reacting."

"Just leave me alone!"

Hiniklat ni Megan ang kumot. Tumambad si Dama na naka-fetal position. Magang-maga ang mga mata nito at gulo-gulo ang buhok.

"Look at you. You're pathetic," Meg said helplessly.

"And whose fault is this?" tanong nito.

"I'm sorry sweetie."

"Yeah. You should be. You ruined my life!" sumbat nito sa kanya.

 

Nasaktan si Megan sa narinig but she didn't retort. Alam naman niyang tama ang anak. Kasalanan niya. She's been a very bad mother to her children.

 

"Don't cry. Hindi naman ikaw ang naagrabyado," saway ng anak sa kanya.

"I'm pregnant. I'm supposed to cry!" pagdadahilan nya.

Mukhang naawa naman ang anak sa kanya. Yumakap ito sa kanya, carefully avoiding to squish her belly.

"Stop crying mommy. Ang pangit mo umiyak."

Instead of stopping, napahagulhol pa ito. "I'm sorry! I'm such a bad mother!"

"I'm sorry too. I'm such a bad child." Pinahid nito ang mga luha niya. "All I ever remembered are the bad things. Kinalimutan ko yung mga magagandang bagay na ginawa mo para sa 'kin. I'm sorry mommy."

In spite of the tears, hindi napigilang ngumiti ni Meg.

"Where the hell is my daughter?"

Mapait na ngumiti ang dalaga sa kanya. "I'm right here. New and improved."

"I am so proud of you."

Seryoso syang tinitigan ng anak.

 

"Mommy... where's Zelo? And Manang? Pati si Meera?"

"Their task was done."

"Task?" Lito nitong tanong sa kanya.

"I created the Nasino family so that you will know what it's like to live with an ordinary family. I was intending it to be longer than this... but someone found out who you are... so I have to take action."

"W-What-" Nahulog ang balikat ng dalaga. "Are you saying na-"

"Hindi talaga sila magkakapamilya anak."

 

Mabilis na tumulo ang luha ng dalaga. After all they've been through together... hindi pala sila totoo? Just a fake family to adopt her temporarily. And what about her friends? Are they part of the plan too?

And what about Zelo?

What about them?

 

Wala na bang totoo sa mga bagay na naranasan nya? The laughters, inuman session, kulitan, kainan, bangayan...

The hugs...

The kisses...

 

Where they all part of an act?

 

Xxxx

AN: I'm just so happy that I made an update. Hahaha... So... guys, I told you to remember the name, didn't I? I gave you PIERRE... not PIERRE ALESSANDER.

And kulit nyo kase... sabi ng sa last part pa sya eh. I'm just messing with you. ^^v

Please don't lie to me unless you're absolutely sure that I'll never find out the truth.

 

--

 

Ilang araw ng nagkukulong si Dama sa kwarto nya. Ni hindi sya nakikipag-usap kahit kanino. Ang pagkain niya ay dinadala pa ng mga katulong sa kwarto niya.

Maghapon syang nakahilata sa kama. Minsan, sisilip sya sa walk-in closet nya para bisitahin ang mga pinakamamahal nyang damit but she'll end up remembering Eula and Lei and then everything will come back to her.

And then she will start to cry.

 

Kaya bigla nyang titigilan ang pag-re-rearrange at pagsusukat ng mga damit at sapatos para bumalik sa kama nya at umiyak.

 

She has no one to talk to naman outside her family. Really, may kaibigan ba sya? Wala naman eh. Yung mga taong akala nya ay kaibigan nyang tunay, hindi nya alam kung gawa-gawa lang din. Maybe they were just a bunch of penniless teenagers who were paid to make her believe that she have friends.

Maybe this is her curse. Mayaman nga pero hindi masaya.

 

"Sweetie?" she heard her dad call. She didn't answer.

Maya-maya, she heard the door open. She grunted. Bakit ba palagi nyang nakakalimutan na walang kwenta ang pagla-lock nya ng pinto dahil may sarili namang susi ang parents nya?

She sat up and faced her father. Naupo ito sa gilid ng kama nya.

"Are you okay?"

"Of course dad. I'm fantastic!" she answered with sarcasm.

Dani looked sternly at her. "Don't use that tone on me. I'm not your mom."

"Sorry dad. Ikaw naman kase, obvious na, tinatanong pa."

"Well that's because I don't know what to say initially."

Yumakap siya sa ama. "Daddy, do you love me?"

"Of course I do," sagot nito.

"Why?"

 

Kumunot ang noo nito. "Why? Do I have to have a reason for that?"

"Do you just love me because I'm your kid?"

"Why are we having this conversation again?"

She pouted. "Because you asked me if I'm okay."

"Are you?"

"No," sagot niya.

"Don't worry kiddo, everything will be okay." He kissed her forehead.

"Why are you all like that? Why do you keep on telling me that everything will be okay? When dad? When will they be okay?"

"Alam mo anak, lahat ng bagay ay may panahon. It's not meant to be okay today so you're not okay. But someday, I don't know how soon... magiging okay ka rin."

"I wish I could be as optimistic as you dad," she replied.

 

Kumalas ito sa pagkakayakap nya. "You know what? I'll just tell you a story para naman matuwa ka."

"What story?"

Sumandal ito sa headboard ng kama nya. She did the same. Tapos ay inakbayan sya nito.

"I'll you the story of how you were made," her dad said with a wink.

"What? Eww dad. No!"

"What?" kunwari'y malungkot na tanong nito. "It's a good story."

"No way!"

 

Patay-malisya lang ang daddy nya at nagsimula itong magkwento.

"I think we were in the car back then-"

"DAD STOP! SERIOUSLY!" Nagtakip sya ng tenga.

Tumawa naman ito saka nagpatuloy.

"We were a bit drunk that night. I think kakatapos lang yata naming manuod ng movie nun. I don't want to-"

"MOMMY! MAKE IT STOP!"

"-go home yet. That's why I-"

"MOMMY! FOR GOD'S SAKE! MAKE HIM STOP!"

 

The door burst open and came in Meg, na medyo hinapo yata ng kaunti sa kamamadali.

"What's with all the yelling?" iritado nitong tanong sa mag-ama.

"Daddy's such a pervert!" reklamo niya.

"Dad." Meg frowned at her husband. "Ano na naman bang kalokohan ang ginagawa mo?"

"Wala mommy! I'm just telling her a story," sagot ng daddy nya.

"Was it pornographic?"

Dama rolled her eyes. "Very! He's telling me how I was made mom!"

 

To her surprise, her mother laughed. "Really?" Naupo ito sa kabilang side nya. Tapos ay dinungaw nito ang asawa. "Did you tell her about the car scene dad?"

"Well, I was about to," he replied, grinning.

"Honestly! What is wrong with you both?" naiinis nyang tanong. Ang abnormal lang ng parents nya. Ikaw ba naman ang kwentuhan kung paano ka nabuo? Nakakadiri kaya yun.

 

Her parents laughed saka sya niyakap ng sabay.

"We just want to make you laugh sweetie," her mom said.

"Apparently, it didn't work," dagdag ng daddy nya. "But we'll keep on trying."

"Because we love you."

 

They both smiled at her. And she started tearing up again.

"I hate you guys. You're making me cry again. Ang laki-laki na ng eyebags ko eh!"

 

"Do you want to go shopping? I bet it would relieve your stress," her mom suggested.

"But I have enough clothes to last my entire life!" she lamented.

Nagkatinginan ang mag-asawa.

"Well then... shop for me. I need new maternity dresses."

Tiningnan niya ang suot ng ina. "Yeah. No kidding ma. I can't believe you've worn that pathetic excuse of a dress!"

Biglang tumikhim si Dani.

"Your dad chose this one," Meg said blandly.

Hinarap naman nya ang ama. "I mean-no offense dad... but you have no taste in women's fashion."

"Ouch," sagot nito.

 

Maya-maya'y may kumatok sa nakabukas na pintuan ng kwarto niya.

"Uhm... excuse me dad, ate, mommy... our food's ready."

Napansin niyang malungkot ang kapatid. And she knew why. Hindi kase niya makalimutan yung time na nag-confess ito ng hinanakit sa kanya.

"Come here noob," aya niya sa kapatid.

 

Nag-alangan itong lumapit.

"Sit," utos niya.

 

Naupo ito sa may paanan nila. Nakatingin silang tatlo dito.

"What?" mahinang tanong ni Dylan.

Instead of answering him, nilingon niya ang mga magulang. "Mom... dad... is it true na mas mahal nyo ako kesa sa kanya?"

"Ate!"

Kumunot ang noo ng mag-asawa. "What? Of course not. We love you both... equally," sagot ng daddy nya.

Napatungo ang kapatid nya.

"Heard that noob?"

Dylan sniffed. "I'll eat first. Sumunod na lang po kayo."

"Come on... come here. 'Wag kang magdrama dyan," she replied.

"Oo nga. Come here son."

 

Sumunod naman ito. She pulled her brother and hugged him tightly. Then she felt her mom and dad hugged them both.

"We love you both."

"Ugh. I hate this. Ang dadrama nyo!" sha exclaimed.

"Look who's talking," her mom retorted.

"Kumain na nga lang tayo. Nagugutom na 'ko," her dad suggested.

So they all went down.

 

--

 

Ngayon lang nakita ni Dama na nakangiti ang mga katulong. Parang ang saya-saya nila na makita silang masaya. When they were eating, limang katulong ang nakaantabay. She felt weird. Para kaseng hindi na sya sanay ng may nanunuod sa pagkain nila na hindi naman kumakain.

"Dad, can't they eat with us? I can't eat with all of them staring." And she was sure that they were hungry given na hindi pa pwedeng kumain ang mga ito hanggat hindi pa sila kumakain.

Nagtaas ng kilay ang mommy nya. "Are you sick?"

"Don't you think it's a waste of resources kung ganito karami ang ulam tapos tayo lang ang kakain?"

Napatawa ang mommy nya. "I can hardly recognize you with all those change." She motioned to the maids. "Kumain na rin kayo."

Nagkatinginan ang mga katulong.

"Go ahead."

 

Isa-isa silang naupo sa hapag-kainan. May isang kumuha ng plato mula sa kusina.

"Telma, pakisabi sa ibang katulong na kumain na rin," utos ng mommy nya kay Telma.

Agad itong tumayo. "Opo ma'am."

 

There. Eh di walang naglalaway. Tss.

 

Dama saw her brother smile at her. Inirapan na lang nya ito.

 

--

 

After eating, nag-ready na ang mag-ina for their shopping spree. Shop till you drop daw. Dama was given her old credit cards back. Lima iyon lahat-lahat. All have money na hindi bababa sa 20 thousand each.

Iniisip pa lang nya kung paano uubusin ang perang yun, sumasakit na ang ulo nya.

 

First, they went to some high end stores. And instead of choosing maternity dresses for her mom, parang sya pa ang pinabibili nito ng mga bagong gamit para sa sarili nya.

"Mom... I've had enough already. Let's buy you some new dress," pagtanggi niya.

Ngumiti lamang ang mommy nya at saka sila nagpunta sa tindahan na exclusively eh for pregnant women lang.

She kept on rolling her eyes as the saleslady proves to be so much of a kiss-ass.

"Mom, don't pick that. It's ugly." Hinaklit nya mula sa ina ang isang bulaklaking dress na mukhang 80's dress pa yata. "Choose this one instead." She gave her mom the purple dress that she's been eyeing since they entered the shop.

Pumasok ang mommy nya sa fitting room. Naiwan naman syang naniningin ng iba pang damit. Pansin nya lang, nang pumasok ang mommy nya sa fitting room, hindi na sya pinansin nung saleslady.

She decided to shrug it off. Naningin na lang sya ng accessories na nakalatag sa isang glass table. Her eyes were fixed on this charm bracelet.

Naaalala nya tuloy si Eula. Eula loves charm bracelets...

She picked it up.

 

"Sweetie?"

 

Nilingon nya ang ina. "Yeah. That's better." She gave her a thumb up. "Mom, can I buy this?"

"Sure," mabilis nitong sagot.

 

They ended up with five shopping bags, all filled with her mom's new clothes. Wala syang nabili kundi yung bracelet na yun para kay Eula.

And she was kinda proud of herself. Never pa nyang na-contain ang urge na mag-waldas ng pera. Siguro isa na ring factor ang pagiging depressed nya.

 

They went home after that. And for the first time, nakasalo na ulit sya ng pamilya over dinner. Ngayon lang kase sya hindi dumeretso ng kwarto. Her mom insisted that they should eat at the house. Eh kanina pa sya gutom na gutom.

Ayun, kaya dumeretso na sila ng kusina pagkauwi at sabay na kumain.

 

--

 

The day after that was quite boring. She just stayed on her room, arranging and rearranging her clothes and shoes. Ang boring.

Yung iba nyang damit, ni hindi pa natatanggal sa plastic na nakabalot. Naka-hanger lang sila dun, ilang buwan na rin ata.

She used to arrange her clothes by designer. Nitong pagbalik nya, ginawa nya namang by color. This morning, dahil wala syang magawa, ini-arrange naman nya ang mga ito according to her liking.

Nakabukod ang pinaka-paborito nya. Yung less favorite. And the ones that she hate. Yung mga tipong regalo sa kanya ng mga taong hindi naman kasundo ang taste nya.

 

Little heart, if Eula was here... I'm sure she'll love this.

 

Or is that even her name? She's not sure. And what of Tassie? Is that really her attitude or part of an act lang din?

Confused, she got out of the room and decided to roam around the house instead.

Napadpad sya sa likod-bahay nila.

 

And hope was finally rekindled when she saw the child petting one of their dogs.

"Meera!"

Patakbo nya itong nilapitan.

Agad namang tumayo ang bata pagkakita sa kanya. Bahagya itong yumuko.

"Good morning po Miss."

"Miss ka dyan! Ate na lang!" nakangiti niyang sabi.

Ngumiti din ang bata. "Sorry po. Wala po kase ako sa posisyon para tawagin kayong ate."

"Meera naman..."

"Pero kung yun po yung utos nyo eh susunod po ako."

Ginulo nya ang buhok nito. "I'm not commanding you to call me ate. I'm asking you a favor. So please... call me ate na lang, okay?"

Tumango ito.

"Nasan si Manang Pacing?"

"Nasa bahay po ng lolo ng papa niyo."

"Kina Lolo Stephen?" she asked.

Tumango ito.

"Eh si Kuya Zelo mo?"

 

"Hindi ko po alam."

 

"Meera..."

"Promise po! Di ko po talaga alam. Hindi na po kami nagkita mula nung bumalik kayo."

"Alam ba ni Manang kung nasan sya?"

Umiling ang bata. "Hindi ko po alam."

She sighed. "Ganun ba? Di mo talaga alam? Bawal ang magsinungaling."

Tumingin ito ng deretso sa kanya. "Di ko nga po alam ate."

"Talaga ha? Kapag may balita ka, sabihin mo agad sa 'kin ha?"

"Opo."

 

Niyakap nya ito.

"Namiss kita!"

 

 

 

 

 

Pati ikaw... kung nasan ka man.

 

AN: 2 long updates. Hahaha... feeling ko bawing-bawi ko na yung almost two weeks kong absent. Ayan. Good night. Think whatever you like... ako ang bahala sa twists. ^^v

You are a piece of me I wish I didn't need.

 

--

 

Dama groaned as her eyes got hit by the rays of the sun. Bigla-bigla kaseng hinawi ng mommy nya ang kurtina ng kwarto nya dahil umaga na.

"Ma..." ungot niya sa ina saka sya nagtalukbong ng kumot.

"Time to wake up. You need to get ready for school."

"What school?"

"The old one," sagot ng mommy nya.

"I hate my life," she said, resigned. Napilitan syang bumangon. "Do I really have to go back there?"

Her mother shrugged. "Not really. But I want you to." Tumabi ito sa kanya. "Listen... you need to go out. Kung magboboryo ka lang dito eh talagang malulungkot ka. Go out. Bitch around. I don't care. Just... live."

"I thought you like having me around?" kunot-noo nyang tanong sa ina.

"Of course I do. But I don't want you to confine yourself here. Pumapangit ka na kakasimangot."

 

Sinimagutan nya ang ina. "Ansama mo."

Tumawa ito at pinalapit sya. "Come here. I'll help you pick your dress."

"No thanks. I don't trust your pregnant taste."

Hinila sya ng mommy nya by the arm. She had no choice but to come go inside the walk-in closet. Nakita nyang bahagyang na-surprise ang ina sa bagong ayos ng mga gamit niya.

"Where the heck are those Chanel dresses?" tanong nito.

 

Karaniwan kaseng pampasok niya yung mga damit na galing sa Chanel. Simple kaseng tingnan. She tried a more Avant Garde look once by wearing a McQueen dress, hindi sya pinalabas ng bahay hangga't hindi sya nagpapalit.

Bawal kase syang magpaka-Lady Gaga kapag regular school day.

 

"I don't know. Nagkahalo-halo na sila eh."

Her mom grunted. "Kailangan ko na naman bang papuntahin ang stylist mo dito para maayos 'tong closet mo?"

 

"Don't bother mom. I like it this way."

Megan sighed. "Just choose a simple dress and get ready for school."

She rolled her eyes. "Yes ma..."

 

Lumapit sa kanya ang ina at hinalikan sya sa noo. She felt her mom's huge belly on her stomach. Ewan nya pero parang gusto nyang matawa. She was so used to seeing her mom all fit and well put together. Ngayon, mukha talaga itong nanay kase buntis.

Hindi masyadong maayos ang buhok. Walang make-up. Nananaba.

And yet... the way her dad looks at her mom was quite fascinating. Na para bang ito lang ang babae sa mundo. She wanted that kind of love. Yung parang walang kasawaan.

Parang walang katapusan.

 

"Sweetie?"

"What?"

"Are you okay?"

Tumango siya. "Yes ma."

"I'll prepare your breakfast. Maligo ka na ha?"

She rolled her eyes. "Yes ma."

Ngumiti ito. "Okay. I love you."

"Ang korni mo mommy," she said with a pout. Biglang nag-iba ang timpla ng ina. Sinimangutan siya nito.

"Whatever."

"Tss. Tampo naman agad 'to. O sya sige, I love you too," sabi niya sabay ngiti.

"Ayoko na. You're too late."

Natatawa syang yumakap sa ina. "Asus si mommy. Nagtampo naman agad."

"Minsan na nga lang akong magpaka-sweet, binabara mo pa."

"Eh joke nga lang. Eto naman, masyadong touchy. Ganyan na ba kapag tumataba?"

Her mom slapped her hand. "I hate you!"

 

Dama laughed.

 

"Sige na ma... bumaba ka na. Baka mag-away pa tayo."

"Bilisan mo ang kilos ha."

"Yes ma."

 

--

 

After contemplating so hard on what to wear, she settled for her Button Collar Bow Short-Sleeved Knitted Cotton White Dress from Chanel. To put it simply, white dress na may sleeves na maikli. Kailangan lang talagang pagandahin ang pagkakasabi para masabing designer ang damit.

It was actually one of her cheapest dress. Mga 89 dollars lang yata. Regalo lang kase ito sa kanya.

She went down after readying herself. Nakapag-makeup na sya ulit... yung mamahalin. That's always a good thing.

That lifted her spirit up.

Kaya lang, it hit rock bottom ulit ng maalala nya ang peste nyang best friend na si Eula. Naiinis na nga sya... lahat kase ng bagay na may kinalaman sa pagpapaganda ay nagpapaalala sa kanya dito.

 

Shrugging the feeling off, she headed to the dining area. Nakahanda na ang mga pagkain at sya na lamang ang hinihintay. Nakaupo na ang daddy nya at nagkakape habang si Dylan ay naglalagay ng butter sa toast nito.

Kakalapag naman ni Meg ng pancakes sa mesa ng mapatingin ito sa kanya.

"What took you so long?" tanong nito sa kanya.

Nagkibit-balikat lamang sya saka naupo sa tabi ng kapatid.

 

"Good morning ate," bati nito sa kanya.

Tinapunan nya ito ng tingin. "Morning," tipid nyang sagot.

Inihaya nito ang pinalamanang tinapay sa kanya. "Gusto mo?"

She shook her head. "No thanks."

"Sweetie, pwede bang dalawang yaya na lang muna ang kasama mo pagpasok? May sakit si Telma eh," tanong ng mommy nya from across the table.

"No need ma."

 

Napatingin silang lahat sa kanya. Ang daddy nya ay napahinto sa pagbabasa. Si Dylan naman ay maang na napatingin sa kanya.

"What did you just say?" her father asked.

"I said I don't need maids. Malaki na 'ko," she said quite proudly. Nakita nyang nagpalitan ng tingin ang mga katulong.

Nagtaas ng kilay ang mommy nya. "Do you think you can handle school on your own?"

She raised her chin a bit. "Of course. I survived a public school. How much harder would my old school be without my maids?"

Her dad chuckled. "Uh-probably... a lot?"

"Wag kang KJ dad. I'm the queen of that school, I can handle myself."

 

--

 

But she wasn't prepared for the changes that transpired when she was gone. Ang dati'y pauso nyang no uniforms allowed, ngayon ay napalitan na.

She literally stood out because she's the only one not wearing a proper uniform.

Marami ang nanlaki ang mata upon seeing her. Nagulat ang mga ito dahil nandito syang muli, nakatapak sa school na dati ay pinagbibidahan nya.

"Well... look who's back!"

 

"Reema?"

 

Reema crossed her arms. "That's Student Council President Reema Onchangco for you. What are you doing here? Tapos na ang rehab mo?" nakangisi nitong tanong.

"Actually, I'm under medication. I still have anger issues, you know. The doctor said the psychopath in me might come out anytime, especially when provoked."

Bahagyang nabahala si Reema. Dama smiled. Yeah bitch, be afraid. Be very afraid.

"W-Why are you released?!"

She shrugged. "Anyway, why are you wearing uniforms? Naghihirap na ba kayo at wala na kayong maipambili ng damit?"

"It's called cost-cutting. Mahirap na ang economy ng bansa. Kelangan ng magtipid," paliwanag nito.

"So? I'm not affected," she replied blandly.

"Siguro ngayon hindi mo pa nararamdaman. Hindi kase ikaw ang kumikita ng sarili mong pera."

"Kaya nga. Mayaman kase ako."

Ngumiti ito sa kanya. "Parents mo ang mayaman, hindi ikaw."

"Whatever. I want everything back to normal starting tomorrow. Lose those crappy uniforms. Magmumukha tayong public school."

"I can't just do that! As the student council president-"

"About that--" putol  niya. "You should step down. Hindi bagay sa 'yong maging figure of authority. Wala kang commanding power."

"Of course I do!"

She raised an eyebrow. "Wanna bet on that?"

 

Without waiting for an answer, she called someone out.

"You with the hair, come here."

Lumapit ang isang babaeng ala-Princess Lea ang ayos ng buhok.

"Bakit po Miss?" nag-aalangan nitong tanong.

"Give me your ID," utos niya.

"Don't," tutol ni Reema.

"I said give it!" paglalakas niya ng boses. The girl scrambled to get the ID off her neck saka nito iyon ibinigay sa kanya.

She smiled victoriously at Reema. "See?"

 

Reema stomped her foot in anger. "It's not supposed to be this way! They're just scared of you!"

"They should be," sagot niya. "No uniforms tomorrow. Cascade that message to the school or else..." sinadya nyang bitinin ang sasabihin.

She knew all too well how to scare people. She's been there. She's been scared. She's been lulled into thinking that she should be afraid of her mom. So she used those techniques para naman makapanakot sa iba.

 

"Akala ko pa naman, nagbago ka na."

 

Her heart skipped a beat when she heard that familiar voice. Marahan syang napalingon sa nagsalita.

 

"Oh... it's just you," disappointed nyang sabi nang makitang si Krauss lang pala ang nasa likuran nya.

"What? Expecting someone else?" kunot-noo nyang tanong.

"No. I'm just plain disappointed because I saw you. Honestly, bat parang pumapangit ka ata?"

Krauss rolled his eyes. "I see you still wear your horns proudly."

"Yeah," she said with a shrug. "They go well with my halo. Well anyway, I'll leave you two alone. Pag-usapan nyo yung utos ko. I want it to be implemented pronto."

With that, she walked off to some place inside the school.

 

Napagawi sya sa cafeteria nila. And she stopped on track when she saw that one of her favorite hangouts was gone.

"Oh my gosh! What happened to Starbucks?!" pasigaw nyang tanong. Pinagtinginan sya ng mga estudyanteng nakatambay sa lugar.

 

--

 

After talking to the administrator, napapayag nya itong ibalik ang paborito niyang Starbucks. It was almost lunch time kaya hindi na rin sya pumasok sa subjects nya. She just went around the school, showing everyone that she's back.

When she got tired, tumambay sya sa isang restaurant. Napansin nyang ilag pa rin sa kanya ang mga estudyante. She wanted to shrug that empty feeling but remembering her other school was hard. She had friends... yun ang masaklap.

Yung naranasan nyang magkaroon ng mga kaibigan and then later on, mawawala rin sila.

Parang... ang sakit lang. Na sana hindi nya na lang naranasan yun. Eh di sana hindi nya alam yung pakiramdam ng may namimiss.

"Ouch-ano ba!" Paasik nyang tiningnan ang isang estudyante na sa sobrang pagka-klutz ay natisod ang upuan nya. Muntik na tuloy malaglag sa damit nya yung chocolate cake na kinakain nya.

"S-Sorry po."

"Nerd!" gulat nyang sabi ng makita kung sino ang estudyanteng patanga-tanga.

"M-Miss!" Mas nagulantang naman ito ng makita sya.

Nginitian nya ito. For some weird reason, she felt oddly comfortable with her.

 

"Sit down," she said to her.

Agad itong sumunod.

"How have you been?" she asked.

"Po?"

"Tinatanong ko kung kumusta ka na."

"Okay lang po," nag-aalangan nitong sagot.

"Ano ka ba. Don't be shy with me... para namang wala tayong pinagsamahan nyan eh!"

Napakunot ang noo nito sa kanya. She was so embarrassed with herself that she had to fake a laugh. Nakalimutan kase nya-wala naman talaga silang pinagsamahan.

 

"Kumain ka na?" pag-iiba nya ng topic.

"Hindi pa po," sagot nito.

"Drop the po, will you? You make me feel older than I should be."

"S-Sige."

 

Dama raised her right hand. "Waiter!" she called. Isang lalaking nakaputing polo at black pants na may apron sa bewang ang lumapit sa kanila.

"Order whatever you like," she said to the nerd.

Tumango ito. "Pesto," maikli nitong sabi sa waiter.

"Yun lang?" tanong niya.

"Hindi naman kase ako gutom na gutom," sagot nito.

"Okay. One pesto," she said to the waiter.

 

Inulit ng waiter ang order nya bago ito umalis. She diverted her attention to the girl.

"Listen, I know you don't treat me as your friend. And I feel the same. But just so I have someone I can hang out with-can we be friends for, say, at least a month?"

"Uh-okay?"

"Good."

 

 

 

 

 

"Welcome back Miss Dama." Sa wakas ay ngumiti na rin ito sa kanya.

xxxxx

AN: Sorry kung sabaw. Limang araw na akong inaantok. Hahaha...

[38] Chapter 37
*******************************************
...you are my sweetest downfall.

--


Bitch sa umaga, iyakin sa gabi. What more to expect from a girl na recently lang ay nawalan ng mga kaibigan at minamahal?

That's Danielle Marie Dirham for you. Some says she's changed. Others don't believe it. Well as for her, she thinks that she just found the lighter side of things. Too bad, they didn't last.

"Sweetie, lolo's nurse called. Pinapapunta ka daw sa bahay nya," bungad ng mommy nya pagkabukas nito ng pintuan.

Walang kagana-gana syang tumingin dito. "Why daw?"

Her mother shrugged. "Beats me. So, pupunta ka?"

She gave her mom a shrug. "I guess I'll go."

Her mom smiled at her saka ito lumabas ng kwarto nya. She changed into a simple Lacoste shirt and a pair of denim shorts before going out. Knowing her lolo, baka sa isang araw pa sya nito pauwiin sa bahay nila.

She didn't bother packing extra clothes though. Marami naman siyang damit sa bahay nito. May sarili na rin syang kwarto. Kaya naman, kahit maglayas siya ng isang taon ay hindi nya ikamamatay.

Mas spoiled kase sya sa lolo nya.

 

--

 

Upon arriving at the mansion, sinalubong sya ng mga nakahilerang katulong. Nakapila ang mga ito sa tigkabilang side ng pintuan.

"Magandang gabi po Miss Dama," they chorused.

 

Oh my gosh... what's wrong with this picture? Why do I feel so off?

 

Nagtataka na talaga sya sa sarili nya. Dati-rati naman ay gustong-gusto nya ng ganito. Yung feeling na luluhod sa 'yo lahat. Wow... being poor really is life-changing. Kahit nga ba hindi pa ganoon kahaba ang experience nya rito.

She walked past the maids. Nasa dulo ng hanay ang lolo nya. Naka-wheelchair ito na tulak-tulak ng isang nurse. May dextrose na nakakabit sa matanda at mukhang mahinang-mahina na ito. Nevertheless, he still found the strength to stand up para salubungin sya at yakapin.

"Apo!" bulalas ng matanda.

"Hi lolo." Gumanti sya ng yakap dito.

"Kumusta ka na?" tanong nito sa kanya.

"Okay lang po. Ikaw?"

"Well," the old man motioned to his wheelchair. "Have you eaten?"

"Yep. Ikaw lolo?"

"I just finished actually. Let's go to my study?" aya nito. Tumango siya. Naupong muli ang matanda sa wheelchair dahil hindi na nito kayang maglakad o tumayo ng matagal.

She offered to push his wheelchair for him. Agad naman itong pumayag. So she rolled the wheelchair up to the study.

 

Nang makarating sila doon ay itinuro ng lolo niya ang isang lamesa na may nakapatong na chess board.

"Maglalaro tayo ng chess lolo?"

Ngumiti ito. "No. I don't play anymore. Masakit sa ulo."

"Then why-"

"I have a proposition for you."

"What kind of proposition?"

"Sit down," utos nito.

 

Naupos sya sa tapat ng matanda.

"I want you to have a chess match with Dyma," agad nitong sabi pagkaupo nya.

"Huh? Why?"

"Wala naman. I just want to see you two play chess. You know, you're really good at it. And Dyma's not that bad. I just haven't seen you play with each other so I don't really know which one is better."

"You said that you have a proposition lolo. What is it?"

 

Pinagdaop ng matanda ang mga palad nito at saka nagpangalumbaba. "If you win, I'll give you one thing. One thing that you wanted the most."

"Anything?" she asked.

Tumango ito. "Name it. As long as it's within my power, I'll give it to you."

"Even this mansion?"

"Yes."

"Even your business empire?"

"Yes."

 

She looked at her lolo's eyes and in all seriousness, she said, "I want Zelo."

Kumunot ang noo ng matanda. "Zelo?"

"Yes lolo. I want to have him back."

"Are you sure you don't want anything else? I can give you my legacy."

"What's the use of all that kung hindi naman ako masaya? You know what lolo, when mom sent me away, I learned that I can be happy with the simplest of things. I thought na the richer a person is, the happier they will be. Mali pala..."

The old man looked impressed by her statement.

"Sigurado ka na ba sa desisyon mo? What about your friends? Don't you want to see them?"

 

Napaisip ang dalaga. Gusto rin niyang makita ang barkada. Pero gusto nyang makita si Zelo. Kung papapiliin sya, sino ang pipiliin nya between the two?

 

--

 

She accepted the proposition of course; it's just that, she wasn't sure if she picked the right prize. It's like choosing between Chanel and Marchesa... mahirap.

Dyma looked determined to win. Kunot na kunot ang noo nito habang nag-iisip ng next move. Palagay nya ay may sinabi rin dito ang lolo nila.

She wondered what her lolo said that could bribe Dyma into winning. Ngayon nya lang kase ito nakitang ganto kaseryoso.

Sa kakatunganga niya sa kapatid, hindi nya napansin na nag-move na ito ng chess piece. Napatingin na lamang sya sa board nang itumba nito ang queen nya.

"Checkmate!" tuwang-tuwa nitong sabi.

Napapalatak siya. "You cheated!" bintang niya sa nakababatang kapatid.

"Hindi kaya," tanggi nito. Saka ito ngumiti sa kanya.

 

She slumped on the chair. Hindi ba meant to be na makita nya si Zelo? Of all the days, why did she have to lose today?

 

--

 

Bumalik sa pagmumukmok ang dalaga. Biruin mo ba namang Zelo na, naging bato pa? Hindi niya alam kung ano'ng hiniling ng kapatid niya sa lolo niya.

She was at her moping state when she heard a knock.

"Come in," walang gana nyang sabi.

"Sweetie?"

Daddy nya pala.

"Yes dad?"

"You have visitors," nakangiti nitong sabi sa kanya.

She looked expectantly at the door. Unang pumasok si Eula, na nag-aalangang tumingin sa kanya. Kasunod nito ang tatlo pa niyang kabarkada.

"Eula!" patakbo siyang lumapit at yumakap dito. "I missed you!" Niyakap din niya ang tatlo. "I missed you guys!"

"I'll go ahead," nakangiting paalam ng daddy nya.

"Thanks daddy!"

 

Her father chuckled. "Thank your brother. He's the one who made this happen."

She mentally noted na papasalamatan nya ang kapatid mamaya. But first things first. "Kumusta na kayo? Namiss ko kayo. Sobra!"

Hindi sumagot ang mga ito. Keeme was busy looking at her canopy bed. Si Lei naman ay nakatingin lang sa kanya. Eula was looking away and Eli... well, Eli is looking at her aquarium.

Napasimangot sya. "Galit pa rin ba kayo?"

"Bakit kase hindi mo sinabi? Mukhang pera ba talaga ang tingin mo sa 'min?" tanong ni Eula sa kanya.

"Of course not! Natakot lang naman ako eh... na baka kapag nalaman nyo, iwasan nyo na lang ako bigla."

 

"Nakakahiya naman kase kung sa prinsesa pa kami makikipagkaibigan di ba?" sabat ni Lei.

"I'm no princess. Mayaman lang kami," pagtatama nya dito.

"Everybody treats you like one. Tingnan mo nga, kwarto mo pa lang, prinsesang-prinsesa na ang dating."

"Eh sa gusto ko ng ganitong kwarto eh. Bakit ba?"

"Tss. Spoiled masyado."

 

"Ate!" saway ni Eula sa kapatid.

 

"Okay lang Euls. Namiss lang ako nyan," sabi niya sa kaibigan.

"Namiss? Yak! Feeler!" kunwa'y iritado nitong sabi sa kanya.

Hinila niya ito at niyakap. "Oo na nerd, namiss din kita."

"Ano ba!" reklamo nito. Pilit nitong inaalis ang braso nya sa leeg nito but she didn't let go. Alam naman kase nila pare-pareho na namimiss nila ang isa't isa.

Si Lei, kahit may kagaspangan ang ugali, alam niyang deep inside, way deep, ay caring itong tao. Di nga lang nito binibigyan ang sarili ng pagkakataon na ilabas iyong caring side nito.

 

Naiiyak na tuloy sya.

"Oy seryoso... miss na miss ko na kayo."

"Kaya ba pina-kidnap mo pa kami? Grabe! Alam mo bang nagkagulo ang mga kapitbahay nang may dumating na mga lalaking naka-uniform na sakay ng SUV sa 'min?" bulalas ni Eula.

"Sorry naman. Eh kase... baka hindi kayo madaan sa pakiusapan kaya siguro ganun."

 

"Uy Dama, si Nemo ba 'to?"

 

Napatingin silang lahat kay Eli na abalang-abala sa pagmamasid sa mga isda na nasa aquarium nya.

"Nawawala ba?" tanong niya.

"Hindi. Eto oh," sagot nito.

"Oh eh di hindi yan. May part two daw ang Nemo eh. Nawawala sya ulit."

 

Napatawa si Keeme. "Gaguhan pa rin hanggang ngayon?" tanong nito sa kanya.

Ngumiti siya dito. "Syempre, ang dami kong pagmamanahan eh."

 

Kumawala sa kanya si Lei saka ito naupo sa tabi niya.

"Kumusta na kayo ni Zelo?" tanong nito.

 

Hindi sya agad nakasagot. Kumusta na nga naman sila? Meron pa bang sila?

 

As she was pondering on these thoughts, the door burst open.

"Ate!"

"Oh? Bat gulat na gulat ka dyan?" tanong nito sa kapatid na humihingal pa at mukhang kakagaling sa pagtakbo.

 

 

"Si lolo!"

 

xxxx

AN: Sabaw na naman. Hahaha... sensya. Wala na si Zelo. Wag nyo na hanapin. He's meant to disappear just like that. May mga tao talagang nawawala sa buhay natin na hindi natin alam kung bakit. May mga umaalis na lang ng walang paalam.

Masaklap man...

 The pieces of my heart are missing you.




--





Agad na nagtatakbo ang dalaga palabas ng bahay. Kasunod niya ang kapatid at mga kaibigan.

"Get the cars ready!" utos niya sa mga katulong. Nagmamadaling sumunod ang mga ito. Nilingon nya ang kapatid. "Dyma, sina mommy?"

"Nauna na ate," sagot ng kapatid niya.

"Okay." Nagpahid sya ng luhang nakaalpas sa kaliwa nyang mata. Then she snapped back at the maids. "Ano? Nasan na ang sasakyan?!"

"N-Nasa labas na po Miss," sagot nito.

 

Nilampasan niya ang katulong at dere-deretsong pumunta sa sasakyan nilang nakaparada sa harap ng bahay. She hopped inside the car. Sumunod naman si Dyma.

"Ate, stop crying. Lolo will be okay..." pag-aalo sa kanya ng kapatid.

"I hope so too," sagot niya dito.

 

--

 

Hope. It's a beautiful thing. It keeps us going. Pero may mga pag-asang hindi dumarating. Some salvations are not given.

I'm sorry... he didn't make it. Yan ang mga katagang dumurog sa puso ng dalaga. Bakit ba lahat ng mahal niya ay kinukuha sa kanya? Una si Zelo... ngayon naman ay ang lolo niya. It's as if life is enjoying her misery. It's as if she's not entitled to some happiness.

Niyakap sya ng mga magulang. No words were said. No condolences were exchanged. The hugs said it all.

They were sorry... they were sad... but no one is sadder than her.

 

She just lost her first best friend. She just lost the first man who gave her so much love. Ang lolo niya kase yung nag-iisang tao na kahit kailan ay hindi siya iniwan. He loves her so much that he gave her eveything she wanted, kahit pa labag sa loob nito na ibigay iyon sa kanya.

Whenever she's with her lolo, feeling nya ay hindi sya nag-iisa.

 

And now everything just shattered in front of her very eyes. Her great-grandfather just died... what now life?

 

Her legit lolo was not even as close to her as her great-grandfather. Kaya kahit napakalayo pa ng age gap nila, hindi ito naging hadlang para magkalapit sila ng matanda.

Now he's gone... nawala na yung pinaka-paborito nyang lolo sa mundo...

 

--

 

"Sweetie... nandyan sila sa baba," entrada ng mommy nya pagkabukas na pagkabukas nito ng pinto. Halos dalawang linggo na rin mula nang mailibing ang lolo nya.

Lumipas na ang Pasko... ang pinakamalungkot na Pasko ng buhay nya. Ngayon, ilang araw na lang at Bagong Taon na.

Bagong Taon... may mababago kaya?

 

Tumingin lamang sa labas ng bintana ang dalaga at hindi na sinagot ang ina. Narinig nya itong bumuntong-hininga. Pagkatapos ay narinig na niyang magsara ang pintuan ng kwarto niya.

She slumped back to bed and covered her face with the blanket. Malamig na naman... uso na naman ang yakapan. 

 

When she was still with the Nasino family, she tried imagining what Christmas with them would be like. Ano kaya ang ihahanda nila, o kung may handa man? May regalo kaya syang matatanggap?

Pero wala na eh... wala na yun ngayon.

 

They didn't even celebrate Christmas to grieve over her lolo's death.

 

Napabuntong-hininga ang dalaga.

"Ang lalim..."

 

She snapped her head to where the voice was coming from.

"Keeme!" gulat nyang tawag dito. "What happened to your hair?!"

Yung buhok kase nito na dati ay parang cotton candy na ipinatong lang sa ulo nito ay wala na ngayon. Semikal na si Keeme.

Ngumiti ito sa kanya. "Pinatanggal ko na."

"Bakit?"

"Wala. Kelangan ba may dahilan?" Naupo ito sa gilid ng kama niya. "Nasa baba sina Eula, kumakain."

"Eh bakit nandito ka?" Kinuha niya ang pinakamalapit na teddy bear habang inaantay ang sagot ng kaibigan.

"Pinapatawag ka kase ng mommy mo. Tara sa baba?" aya nito sa kanya.

 

She sighed. "Una ka na."

Nagkibit-balikat ito. "Okay," he said saka ito tumayo para lumabas ng kwarto niya.

 

"Wait Keeme!" pigil niya rito.

Lumingon ito sa kanya at nagtaas ng kilay. "Ano?"

Pinalapit nya ito at pinaupong muli. Sumunod naman ito.

"I have something to ask."

"Ano?" he asked blandly.

"Sino ba talaga sa kanila ang gusto mo?"

"Ha?"

"Between Eula and Lei, sino ba talaga?"

Ngumuso ito sa kanya. "At bakit ko sasabihin sa 'yo?"

Gumanti sya ng pagsimagot. "Come on... I'm depressed... humor me," utos nya rito. Dumila naman ito sa kanya. 

"Depressed ka? Talon ka sa bintana."

 

"Hoy! Ano ba kayo? Kumakain na sila!"

 

Napalingon ang magkaibigan kay Eli, na hinihingal pa mula sa madaliang pag-akyat sa napakataas na hagdanan ng mga Dirham.

"Bakit ba puro pagkain na lang ang nasa isip nyo?" tanong nya sa dalawa.

"Masasarap kase ang pagkain nyo dito," sagot ni Keeme.

"Oo nga! Ang sarap pala ng red velvet cake!" Eli exclaimed.

Dama rolled her eyes. Pero ngumiti na rin sya. Ang kagandahan kase nang may mga kaibigan kang kasama sa bahay eh somehow, nababawasan yung lungkot na nararamdaman mo.

Pinagbakasyon ng mommy niya ang barkada sa mansion. Hanggang 3 Kings sila doon. Lucky for them, second week pa ng January ang resume ng klase.

Makakapaggala sila...

 

They all went downstairs para makisalo sa mga nasa ibaba. Christmas party ng mga katulong at katiwala nila sa bahay. Tradition na iyon ng pamilya. Ngayon nga lang sya nakisali dahil palagi syang wala sa bahay after Christmas.

 

--

 

When New Year came, sabay-sabay silang nanuod ng fireworks mula sa bakuran nila. And then, Dama led them to her room. Pinaupo niya ang mga kaibigan sa kama at pinaghintay sila doon.

She went inside her walk-in closet at kinuha ang mga damit, bag at sapatos niya na hindi na niya ginagamit.

Nanlaki ang mata ng magkapatid upon seeing her things. Mga branded kase ang mga gamit niya. Mamahalin at magaganda.

"Sa inyo na yan."

"Ha? Tingin mo maghi-heels ako?!" eksaheradong tanong ni Eli.

"Shunga. Feeling mo naman sa 'yo ko ibibigay yan?" natatawa nyang sagot dito.

"Oo na. Alam ko naman. Pinapangiti lang kita," nakangiti nitong sabi. "Peace."

 

Naiiling niyang ginulo ang buhok nito. "Haynako baby Eli... sige na nga, sayo na 'tong PS2 ni Dyma."

"Grabe... namimigay ka ng hindi iyo?"

"Eh ano naman? Magkapatid naman kami," sagot nya kay Lei. "Besides, pinaglumaan nya na 'to noh," depensa nya.

"Define pinaglumaan?" tanong ni Eula.

"Last week," sagot nya.

 

"Waaaw. Kayo na mayaman," halos sabay-sabay na sabi ng mga kaibigan niya.

 

"Oo na. Mayaman talaga kami," natatawa nyang sabi. "Wait guys, gusto nyong pumasyal sa school namin?"

Mukhang na-excite ang mga kaibigan sa narinig.

"Talaga? Kelan?"

She shrugged. "Gusto nyo bukas? I'm sure na wala pang masyadong magtuturo kase kaka-resume pa lang ng klase. So... are you game?"

Kanya-kanyang pag-aagree ang barkada.

 

"It's settled then... punta tayo sa school namin bukas!" excited nyang sabi.

 

AN: I'm kinda half-apologetic because this is such a crappy chapter and half-not-giving-a-fig about it because I am so sleepy.

So yeah... bahala na ang hindi makahintay. Marami pang story sa Watty na tapos na... yun unahin nyo. ^^v

"Bakit kelangan pang naka-dress ako?" naiiritang tanong ni Lei. Dama made her wear a Gucci dress na umaabot lang sa kalahati ng hita nito. And also, there's the red Jimmy Choo shoes na ipinagpilitan pa nyang isuot sa paa nito kaya naman galit na galit ito sa kanya kanina.

"Oo nga. At bakit kelangan pang naka-necktie pa kami?" tanong naman ni Keeme na kanina pa hinihila pababa yung necktie nya.

"It's required," she answered while rolling her eyes. Nilapitan niya ito at inayos na muli ang tie nito. Saka nya nilingon ang kaibigang si Eli na kanina pa namomroblema kung paano gagawing bow yung bowtie nito. She grunted. "Hindi ganyan! Kase naman!"

"Bakit ba kase ganto pa dapat ang suot? May party ba sa school nyo?" kunot-noong tanong ni Eli na sinukuan na ang bowtie.

"I told you guys, pre-requisite sya. It's a way for us to differ ourselves from the scholars," paliwanag nya.

"Ano bang suot ng scholars?" tanong ni Eula na kanina pa nakatingin sa salamin, admiring her figure on a Chanel blouse and skirt.

 

"T-shirt and jeans," sagot niya.

 

--

 

After so much fuss, sumakay na ang barkada sa SUV ni Dama at nagpunta na sila sa school. The school was isolated from the rest of the rest of the buildings. May isang mahabang daan na papasok dito. Hindi kayang lakarin kaya lahat ng estudyante ay required na magsasakyan.

After all, mayayaman naman sila.

All of the scholars who are truly poor go to the school thru a shuttle.

 

Dalawang klase ng scholars ang meron sa school nila. Ang unang klase ay yung mga estudyante na can't afford ang tuition pero matatalino. They were dubbed as the nerdy scholars at trabaho nila na i-tutor o tulungan sa pag-aaral ang mga mayayamang estudyante ng academy.

Ang ikalawa ay yung mga estudyante na mayayaman naman pero hindi umabot sa quota o minimum salary requirement sa school. Pauso kase niya na dapat ay 50 million ang minimum na family income ng mga estudyante na papasok sa eskwelahan.

Once na hindi mo ma-reach yung minimum requirement, babagsak ka sa pagiging scholar. In short, magtatrabaho ka because you're a few million less valuable than the rest.

 

Napanganga ang magkakaibigan nang makarating sila sa tapat ng napakalapad na gate ng school. Halos pitong tao ang taas ng gate. May dalawa itong camera na nasa tigkabilang posts at fully automated ito. Walang guards na nakabantay.

Nagulat ang mga kabarkada niya ng bigla na lamang itong magbukas.

"Wow! Automatic?" manghang tanong ni Eli.

"Authorized kase 'tong sasakyan ko kaya makakalampas 'to agad. Only authorized cars can pass."

"Pano nalalaman na authorized?" tanong ni Lei.

"May scanner 'tong gate. It scans the license of the cars. Tapos gini-generate naman nya from the database para tingnan kung maa-identify yung license," paliwanag niya.

"Pano kapag hindi na-identify?"

"Eh di hindi makakapasok," she answered blandly.

"Pano kapag nagpumilit?"

 

She sighed. Mahabang paliwanagan pala 'to little heart. "Next time, ipapa-brief ko kayo sa security ng school. Don't ask me, okay?"

 

--

 

Pagkalampas ng gate, ekta-ektaryang green fields ang madadaanan. Sa bandang kaliwa ay may mga naglalaro ng golf. Sa kanan naman ay maraming puno. Parang-park ba. Nakakita rin sila ng mga archery students na nagpa-practice sa isang animo'y stage na lugar.

A few kilometers away, may nakita na naman silang isang malaking-malaking building na aakalain mong mini-Araneta.

"Ano yun?" tanong ni Eula sa kanya.

"Area for swimming."

"Wow."

"Eh yun?" tanong naman ni Keeme while pointing at another building na kulay berde dahil sa mga halaman at puno na nakatanim sa loob. Made of glass ang buong building na iyon kaya naman kitang-kita ang mga nakalagay na halaman sa loob.

"Greenhouse. For botany students."

"Ilan bang course ang ino-offer nyo dito?"

 

She shrugged. "I lost count."

"Grabe..."

 

Nadaanan din nila ang soccer field, yung gym na para sa basketball at volleyball, yung track and field tapos yung building for the gymnasts.

 

Makalipas ang ilang minuto, nakarating na sila sa main building. The main building was the biggest building on the school. Apat na palapag iyon na kamukha ng mga mamahaling building sa Makati. Sobrang ganda at linis tingnan.

Bumaba sila ng sasakyan.

"Grabe... ilan ang estudyante dito?"

"Around 800," sagot niya.

"Hanep... 800 lang? Eh kasya sampung libo dito sa school nyo ah?"

"Ganun talaga. Mayaman kami so no need to cram."

 

Naglakad sila papasok ng building. May guards na naka-stand by for check point. Pero before sila ma-check, dadaan pa sila sa whole body scanner. When they triggered the alarm, haharangin sila at hindi papapasukin sa building.

Natural ng harangin ang barkada dahil wala silang ID. Yung ID kase nila, yung ini-scan sa pangatlong checkpoint.

So kahit lusot ka sa una dahil wala kang harmful objects na dala, di ka rin makakapasok. After ng checkpoints kase, saka ka pa makakalapit sa mismong pintuan ng building.

 

When they were all inside, umakyat sila sa escalator na nasa gitna ng building.

"Wala kayong normal na hagdan?"

Umiling sya. "Wala."

"Eh elevator?"

"Reserved for disabled and old people lang yun."

 

Upon reaching the 3rd floor, pinakita nya sa mga kaibigan kung ano'ng klaseng classroom meron sila.

"Computer room nyo?" tanong ni Eli ng makita na lahat ng desks ng mga estudyante ay may laptop na nakapatong.

"No. Ganyan talaga lahat ng classrooms," sagot nya.

"Wow! Kanya-kanya kayong laptop?"

"Yes."

"Inuuwi nyo?"

Umiling sya. "Dito lang yan. Meron kaming pang-bahay lang."

"Grabe... eh di pwedeng nakawin?"

 

"No. May sariling FP detector yan. It only opens to the registered student. Stolen laptops have no value."

"Sosyalen," Eula commented. "Eh bakit naka-lock palagi yung rooms? Ang tahimik tuloy."

 

"Every room is sound-proof. Para hindi makaabala sa ibang rooms. Kahit crowded rin sa hallways, hindi maririnig yung ingay sa loob ng klase."

"Kita naman ang loob. Distraction din," puna ni Keeme.

"Hindi naman kita nung mga nasa loob yung mga nasa labas eh. As I've said, the classrooms here were built to the comfort of the students. If they don't know who's looking, hindi sila mahihiya."

 

Hindi uso ang ballpen at papel sa school nila. Everything is online. Pwera na lang kung gusto ng teacher na magpapel sila. In that case, magpapapel talaga sila. All laptops can only send emails to the teacher's. Bawal sa ibang students unless bibigyan sila ng permiso dahil kailangan sa group works.

Lahat ng lessons ay itinuturo thru a projector. Wala na ring libro na kailangang dalhin dahil naka-e-book na lahat at nakalagay sa laptops.

All assignments (kung meron man) ay isinesend ng automatic sa emails na ina-access naman sa bahay ng mga estudyante.

 

Wala na silang kailangang gawin o dalhin. Sarili na lang nila. Minsan nga, kapag hindi sila makakapasok, pwedee silang magpadala ng proxy. Pero hanggang tatlong beses lang and all reasons should be valid.

 

"Let's go to the cafeteria," aya nya sa mga kaibigan.

"Hindi ka papasok?" tanong ni Lei sa kanya.

"No. Tinatamad ako."

"Hanep... kung ganto kaganda yung school namin, di na ako aabsent," sabi ni Eli.

"Hindi nyo kase alam kung anong ugali ng mga tao dito eh."

 

"Bakit? Mas may masama pa sa 'yo?" taas-kilay na tanong ni Lei.

"Oo na Analeigh."

"San tayo pupunta?" tanong ni Keeme sa kanya.

"Cafeteria nga. Bingi?"

Tiningnan sya ng masama nito. "Ano gagawin?"

"Tatambay. Tara dali! Baka masita pa tayo ng school prefects dahil pakalat-kalat tayo sa hallway."

 

"Prefects? Sa Harry Potter?"

 

She rolled her eyes. "Kaartehan nung anak ng school admin. Gusto prefects. Ayaw ng student council."

"Ilang kilometro ang layo mula dito?"

"Malapit lang. Dadaan tayo sa overpass."

 

Kumunot ang noo ng barkada. "Overpass?"

She led them to out the hallway and out the door nearby. Pagkabukas nila, may isang tube-like way na air-conditioned rin.

"Wala bang lugar na walang aircon? Ang lamig eh!" reklamo ni Eula.

"Centralized kase dito. Lahat ng sulok ng school, may aircon."

 

Tinawid nila ang daan papuntang cafeteria. And they were greeted by the smell of every food imaginable. Keeme and Eli almost drooled.

"They cater cuisines from around the world. Pili lang kayo. I'll pay for it."

Parang wala sa sariling naglakad ang magkakaibigan. They started checking out every stall. May mga restaurants pa na sa TV lang nila nakikita.

"Starbucks?"

"Figaro?"

"Aristocrats?"

 

"Walang Jollibee?" tanong ni Eula.

"Wala. Bawal ang fast-food," sagot niya.

"Pero may pizza?" natatawang tanong ni Lei sa kanya. Nakaturo ito sa Greenwich.

"I like pizza," she said.

 

"So kapag gusto mo, pwede?"

"Of course."

"Eh di ikaw na mayaman."

 

She smiled at them saka sya pumasok sa isang mamahaling restaurant. Sumunod ang mga ito. Agad na may lumapit na mga scholars na waiters and waitresses for the day sa kanila at inabutan sila ng menu.

Nakakunot ang noo ng mga barkada niya dahil hindi ng mga ito mabasa ang menu. French kase.

"Wala bang Pinoy food?"

"Why didn't you say so?" She stood up. "Let's go."

 

Dinala niya ang barkada sa isang Pinoy restaurant.

 

"Wow lechon!"

"Lechong paksiw!"

"Liempo!"

"Heart attack!"

 

Nagtawanan sila.

 

"Bat walang masyadong kumakain dito?" tanong ni Eli sa kanya.

"Oo nga. Ang sasarap ng pagkain eh," Eula agreed.

"Ganun talaga. Kapag pasosyal ka, hindi ka kakain sa Pinoy resto. Dun ka dapat sa resto na hindi mabasa ang menu."

 

"Ikaw, kumakain ka dito?"

She shrugged. "Ngayon pa nga lang ako nakapasok dito eh."

"Hashtag... alam na," Keeme said.

"Ayan ka na naman sa Twitter reference mo, wala ka namang Twitter," puna ni Lei.

"Nangingialam ka?" paasik nitong bawi.

 

"Haynako. Mag-aaway na naman kayo? Kumain na lang kaya tayo!"

 

Sumunod ang mga ito at nagsimula ng umorder. Then they started eating. Sakto naman na namataan nya si Nerd.

"Uy Nerd!" she called out. Agad syang pinanlisikan nia Lei. "Not you, okay?" Sinenyasan niyang lumapit ang dalaga. Agad naman itong sumunod.

Ipinakilala niya ito sa mga kabarkada.

 

"Guys, this is Chastene, friend ko."

"Hi," bati nito sa kanila.

"Hello," halos sabay-sabay nilang bati.

 

"Eli, baka matunaw."

 

Napatingin silang lahat kay Eli na kanina pa nakatingin sa dalagang kakarating. Napatingin din ang dalaga kay Eli.

Agad naman itong tumungo at nagconcentrate sa pagkain.

 

"Oy Eli, nananahimik ka ata?"

Eli grunted. "Kumakain ako, wag kayong magulo."

 

Nagtawanan sila.

 

"Saya natin ah?"

 

Natigil sa pagsasaya ang magkakabarkada ng biglang nag-lean sa table nila si Oliver.

"Musta?" tanong nito.

"Student ka rin dito?" takang-tanong ni Dama.

Umiling ito. "No. I was just asked to give you something." Inabutan siya nito ng isang papel na nakatiklop. "I'll go ahead. May shooting pa 'ko," paalam nito.

 

Nang makaalis si Oliver ay nagkatinginan ang mga ito.

"Anong nakalagay?" tanong ni Eula.

 

She looked at the paper.

 

 

FROM AUTHOR-nakalagay sa ibabaw ng pagkakatiklop. She unfolded it and gasped.

"Bakit? Ano'ng sabi?" curious namang tanong nina Eula.

 

Tiningnan niya ng mataman ang mga ito... saka sya ngumiti.

AN: Next UD is after Lenten Season. I'll miss you guys! *u*

*******************************************
[41] Chapter 40
*******************************************
I have PMS and a GPS... which means that I'm a bitch and I will find you!

--

Takang-taka ang mga tao sa mansion nang umuwi ang dalagang malaki ang ngiti sa labi. Masayang-masaya ito at kulang na lamang ay yakapin ang mga katulong sa bahay as greeting.

"What is up with you tonight?" asked Meg. Nakaupo ang pamilya sa hapag-kainan at kasalukuyang naghahapunan. Hindi makakain ang dalaga sa kangingiti.

"Nothing. I'm just... happy," she answered with giggles.

Pinagtaasan sya ng kilay ng ina. "Ano'ng meron?" tanong nito.

She just shrugged and smiled.

 

--

 

After eating, she immediately went to her room, slumped back to her bed and stared at the paper given to her earlier by Oliver.

Pinaulit-ulit nyang basahin ang nakasulat doon. It's an address.

So nasa North Carolina ka pala... She smiled to herself again.

 

--

 

"Mommy, can I go to North Carolina?" she asked her mom the next day.

Kumunot ang noo ng mommy nya. "At ano naman ang gagawin mo dun?"

"I'll visit a friend."

"Friend? You have a friend in North Carolina?" hindi makapaniwalang tanong ng ina.

"Yeah," she answered, nodding.

"What kind of friend are we talking about?"

 

She sighed. "Mom, can I be honest with you?" she asked.

"Why? Aren't you being honest with me?"

She gave her mother a bland look. Nilapitan niya ito at kinapitan sa braso. "Ma... I think I-I think I'm in love."

Matagal silang nagkatinginang mag-ina. Mga limang minuto rin siguro.

 

Then her mother laughed. She was laughing so hard na hindi nito mapigilang hindi sya hampasin sa braso.

"Ma! I'm serious!" naiirita niyang sabi.

Napahawak ang ina sa tiyan nito at sinikap na seryosohin ang kanyang sinabi. "How can you fall in love?"

Sinimangutan niya ito. "As if that's impossible."

"I'm sorry, okay? I just couldn't fathom the idea of you falling in love," paliwanag ng ina sa kanya.

"Well, I am," buong paninindigan niyang sabi.

"Kanino?" tanong ng ina.

 

"With Zelo."

 

"Zelo?"

"Yes. Zelo."

Inakbayan sya ng ina. "Well, I guess that can't be helped."

"And that's why I'm going to North Carolina."

Her mom's face finally showed comprehension. "Ah... nandun nga pala sya."

"See? You know and yet you didn't tell me," she said with a pout.

"How the hell am I supposed to know that it matters to you? You're the one who's not telling me anything."

"Maglalabasan na naman tayo ng sama ng loob mommy? Why not let me go first and then I'll fill you in with the details pagbalik ko, hmm?" pangungumbinsi niya sa ina.

 

"Ask your dad," maikli nitong sagot.

 

--

 

Inantay ng dalagang dumating ang ama mula sa trabaho. Pagkadating nito, sinalubong niya ito agad at kinuha ang maleta mula sa kamay nito. When he sat down, tinulungan nya pa ito sa pagtatanggal ng sapatos nito na karaniwan ay gawain ng ina.

"May kailangan ka?" agad na tanong ng daddy nya.

Nagkatinginan sila ng ina na noon ay nasa puno ng hagdan at iintindihin sana ang daddy nya kung hindi lang nya ito naunahan.

Pinagtaasan siya ng kilay ng ina saka ito umakyat.

 

"Dad..." she started.

"Yes?" her dad inquired.

"Dad, do you love mom?"

 

Kumunot ang noo ng daddy niya. "Of course," sagot nito.

"Are you willing to do anything for her?" she asked.

"Oo naman!"

"Are you willing to follow her wherever she goes?"

"I am."

 

"Then... maiintindihan mo naman siguro kung susundan ko si Zelo sa North Carolina tama?" mabilisan niyang tanong.

Tumango-tango ang daddy niya. "Yes, of cour-wait-what?!"

She sighed. "Just say yes dad para wala ng problema."

"Yes to what again?"

"Daddy naman... bawal na ulitin."

"Then my answer is no." Prenteng sumandal ang daddy niya at nag-de-kwatro.

"Dad naman eh!" She pouted. "I thought you'd do anything for mom? Why can't I do the same for him?"

 

"Sweetie, bata ka pa," Dani said.

"I'm already 18!" reklamo niya sa tonong may pagtatama.

"Precisely my point! You're too young!"

She gave her dad a dead-eye stare. "Dad. You got married at 23. Before that, maaga pa lang lumandi ka na. I heard from lola that you had your first girlfriend when you were 10. Bakit ako hindi pwede? Eh 18 na 'ko!"

"It was different back then!" pagdadahilan ng daddy nya.

"Really? How so?" She crossed her arms and waited for his explanation.

 

Napaisip ang daddy nya. "Back then... wala pang internet!"

She rolled her eyes at her dad. "Come on dad. That's lame."

Napabuntong-hininga ito at tiningnan siya ng mataman. "How can you be so sure that you're in love? You might just be infatuated with the idea..."

 

"I think I'm old enough to know the difference dad. And you and mom are both saying that I am too young to love but maybe you're just too old to remember. Come on dad..."

 

"Are you sure on this?" tanong ng ama.

"Do you trust me dad?" pabalik nyang tanong.

 

"Can I trust you?" pabalik na tanong ng ama.

"Are we playing 20 questions?"

Her dad sighed again, his shoulders slumping in defeat. "Fine. Ask your mom though."

"But-I already asked her!"

"What did she say?"

 

"She said to ask you," she answered with a pout.

Tumawa ang daddy nya. "I guess that's a yes."

 

"Yes!" Napapalakpak ang dalaga sa sinabi ng ama. "Thank you daddy!" Niyakap niya ito at hinalikan sa pisngi.

"You're welcome princess."

 

--

 

Agad na nag-empake ang dalaga ng mga damit. Dalawang malaking maleta ang inihanda niya kaya naman kanina pa nakataas ang kilay ng mommy niya habang pinapanuod syang mag-empake.

"Wala ka nang balak umuwi?"

She smiled at her mom. "Syempre meron mommy. Siguro next month."

"No. One week lang."

Nagdabog siya. "Ma!"

"One week... or you won't go," her mom said in finality. Wala na syang nagawa kundi kalahatiin ang dala.

 

--

 

Madaling-araw kinabukasan ay lumipad na ang dalaga papuntang Wilson, North Carolina kung saan nag-aaral si Zelo. Sa Barton College ito kasalukuyang pumapasok. Akalain mo nga namang may pagka-artsy pala ito. Arts and Design kase ang kinuha nitong major.

 

Ilang oras din bago nag-land ang private jet ng dalaga. Upon landing ay may nakaabang ng sasakyan para ihatid siya sa mismong school.

Jet-lagged, nagpahinga muna ang dalaga sa isang pang-mayamang hotel and tried to think of a plan... ano nga ba ang plano nya upon seeing Zelo?

Will she act surprised? Will she act angry? How will she act? And how will he react?

 

--

 

Nang kasunod na umaga ay agad na naghanda ang dalaga at nagpunta sa school na pinapasukan ni Zelo. Hindi niya alam kung saan ito hahanapin pero sinimulan nya sa obvious. Sa building nito.

She's been asking random students pero walang makapagturo kung nasaan ito. Hanggang sa makarating sya sa pinakadulo ng building. May mga students na naghuhulma ng clay. Pottery class yata.

"Excuse me." Kinuhit niya ang nasa gilid na Amerikano.

"Yes?" tanong nito sa kanya.

"Uh-I'm looking for someone."

Tumigil ang lalaki sa ginagawa at tiningnan siya ng mataman. "Would that be me?" tanong nito saka ngumiti sa kanya.

"No. Actually, he's Asian. Black hair, chinky eyes, yellow skin... ring a bell?"

 

"You just described a typical Asian guy miss. Care to tell me anything else?"

She grunted. "Ano pa bang pinagkaiba ng mokong na yun?" tanong nya sa sarili.

"What's that?" tanong ng Kano sa kanya.

"Are there many grumpy Asian guys out here?"

 

Kumunot ang noo nito. "Well, I only know one. Hey Lance!" tawag nito sa kasama.

"Yep?"

"Do you know any grumpy Asian guy besides him?" tanong nito dun sa Lance.

Nag-isip si Lance... at maya-maya'y umiling. "Nah... I don't think so. Asian guys are always smiling... well... except him."

"Him?" naiintrigang tanong ng dalaga. Wala ba syang pangalan at HIM kayo ng HIM?

 

"We call him Grumpy. He's always moping around, you know," paliwanag ni Lance.

"Hey, maybe you could cheer him up. Are you his girlfriend?" tanong ng kano na kanina pa niya kausap.

"Yes, I am," agaran niyang sagot.

"You're cute," puri ni Lance sa kanya. Nginitian lamang niya ito.

 

"Where can I find him?"

 

Nilampasan siya ng tingin ng dalawa at saka sabay na tumuro sa likuran niya.

"He's right there," halos sabay nilang sabi.

Agad siyang lumingon at napangiti ng makita ang paparating.

 

Agad namang tumigil sa paglalakad si Zelo ng makita siya. Nanlaki ang mga mata nito sa gulat. She, on the other hand, seized the opportunity na hindi ito makagalaw sa kinatatayuan.

"Zelo!"

Patakbo syang yumakap dito.

"A-Anong ginagawa mo dito?" tanong nito sa kanya.

"Sinusundan ka," nakangiti niyang sagot.

Itinulak sya nito palayo.

 

"Hey grumpy, you didn't tell me you have a cute girlfriend. What's her name?" tanong ni Lance kay Zelo. Lumapit ito sa kanya at ngumiti.

"I don't like her," sagot naman ng binata.

Nasaktan ang dalaga sa narinig.

 

Magsasalita pa sana sya ng bigla syang inakbayan ni Lance. Sa haba ng biyas nito, yung kalahati lang ng braso nito ang sumayad sa balikat niya. Madumi ang kamay nito dahil sa clay kaya naman yung sa may bandang armpits nito ang nakapatong sa balikat niya.

"Hey, hands off," mariing sabi ni Zelo.

Namay-awang si Lance, never minding the dirty clay on his clothes. "I thought you said you don't like her?" kunot-noo nitong tanong kay Zelo.

 

"She's still my girlfriend. Back off!" paasik nitong sabi. Agad namang umurong si Lance.

"Geez! Calm down grumpy! I'm not gonna steal your girlfriend!" pagkasabi'y kumindat ito sa dalaga at iniwanan sila.

 

Nilapitan siya ng binata. "Umuwi ka na."

"Aba!" Sumimangot siya dito. "Kakarating ko nga lang, papauwiin mo na 'ko?"

"Umuwi ka na, wala akong panahon sa 'yo."

Umungot siya at yumakap sa bewang nito. "Eeee..."

Pilit naman nitong tinanggal ang kamay niya. "Umuwi ka na."

"Ayoko nga!"

 

Napabuntong-hininga ito saka sya binulungan.

"Ano'ng gagawin ko dun?" kunot-noo niyang tanong.

"Umuwi ka. Antayin mo 'ko," sagot nito.

Napangiti siya. "Sure! Apartment mo?"

Tumango ang binata. "Uwi na." Marahan sya nitong itinulak palayo.

"Opo. Sunod ka agad ah?"

 

"May klase pa 'ko."

"Skip it," utos niya.

"Ayoko. Uwi na!" pagtataboy nito.

"Tss. Oo na!"

 

--

 

Maganda ang apartment na tinutuluyan ni Zelo. She's guessing na bigay din ito ng mommy nya. Pati siguro ang pagpapaaral dito ay courtesy na rin ng mommy nya. 

Nilibot nya ang buong bahay. Malinis ito. Typical Zelo, ayaw ng makalat.

Kakaunti rin ang gamit. Naghahanap nga sya ng picture nya pero asa naman sya.

 

Halos limang oras pa siyang nag-antay bago dumating ang binata.

"I ordered pizza," salubong niya rito.

Tiningnan nito ang isang box ng Domino's na hindi pa nagagalaw. "Kumain ka na," sabi nito sa kanya.

"Sabay na tayo."

"May trabaho pa 'ko," sagot nito.

"Bakit ka pa magtatrabaho?" tanong niya.

 

"Masamang magtrabaho?" pabalik nitong tanong.

"Absent ka muna!"

"Hindi pwede."

She stomped her foot. "Zelo naman eh!"

Nagtanggal lang ito ng bag, nagbihis ng t-shirt at saka isinukbit na muli ang sling bag nito. Tapos ay naglakad ito papunta sa may pintuan.

"Aalis na 'ko," paalam nito sa kanya.

 

Hindi na nya ito napigilan ng nagmamadali itong umalis. Naiwan syang walang kasabay sa pagkain. She ate anyway dahil gutom na rin sya.

After eating, nag-ikot-ikot syang muli sa bahay nito at nang mapagod ay natulog siya sa kama nito.

 

--

 

Hindi na namalayan ng dalaga na dumating na si Zelo at tumabi sa kanya. Yumakap ito sa kanya ng mahigpit.

"Nakakainis ka. Bakit ba kase nagpakita ka pa?" tanong nito sa natutulog na dalaga. He kissed her forehead at saka sya umalis para mahiga sa sofa.

Lying down, he stared at the ceiling above him.

 

Kung kelan naman nya sinusubukang kalimutan ang dalaga, saka naman ito nagpakita sa kanya.

 

"Badtrip!"

Mahimbing pa rin ang tulog ng binata dahil sa pagod ito sa trabaho. Halos umaga na ito nang nakauwi. Idagdag pa ang stress nito dahil nasundan ito ni Dama. Dahil dito, hindi namalayan ng binata na naka-Indian sit na ang dalaga sa gilid niya. Pinapanuod lamang sya nitong matulog.

Had it not been for his alarm ay hindi pa sana ito magigising.

 

Unang bumungad sa dito ang mukha ng dalaga na nakatungo. Nakangiti si Dama.

"Good morning!" she greeted.

Zelo grunted saka sya nito tinalikuran. Nagtalukbong ito ng unan at nagsimulang matulog uli. Pero hindi nya hinayaang matulog ng binata. Niyugyog nya ito at kinulit-kulit hanggang sa wala na itong nagawa kundi bumangon.

"Bumangon ka na. Malilate ka na."

"Wala akong pasok!" iritado nitong sabi.

"Ah... wala ba? Eh di okay! Date tayo?"

"Magtatrabaho ako," he answered blandly.

"Trabaho na naman?" Sumimangot ang dalaga. There she was, thinking that Zelo would be ecstatic upon seeing her. Yung tipong aayawan nitong mapahiwalay sa kanya.

Talk about failed expectations.

 

"Hindi kase ako mayamang katulad mo."

"Kasalanan ko bang ipinanganak akong mayaman?" tanong niya dito.

Hindi ito sumagot. Instead, he got up from the couch and went straight to the bathroom. Mga labinglimang minuto rin ito doon. Pagkalabas nito, paligo na ito.

Dama blushed when she saw him half-naked. Parang hindi na sya nasanay eh madalas nya naman itong makita na nakahubad noong nasa bahay pa sila ng mga Nasino. Ang kaso nga lang ay dadalawa na sila ngayon. Feeling nya tuloy nasa honeymoon stage sila.

 

Napansin ata iyon ng binata kaya agad itong nagbihis.

 

Next stop, nagtimpla ng kape si Zelo. Para sa sarili lang nito. It's as if she's not in the house with him. Sinundan niya ito sa maliit na kusina ng apartment at saka sya nagtimpla ng sariling kape.

"Labas naman tayo," aya niya dito.

"May trabaho nga ako."

"Di ba pwedeng umabsent ka muna? Ano bang trabaho mo?" tanong nito sa binata.

"Waiter. May malapit na Chinese restaurant dito. Dun ako nagtatrabaho," sagot ng binata.

"Preparation na ba yan?" nakangisi niyang tanong.

 

"Preparation saan?" kunot-noong tanong ng binata.

 

"Para sa future natin," sagot ng dalaga. "Nag-iipon ka na para kapag kinasal tayo eh may pambuhay ka sa 'kin?"

Natawa ang binata sa sinabi niya. "Tingin mo papakasalan kita?"

Agad siyang napasimangot. "Bakit? Hindi ba?"

"Ayoko sa 'yo. Wala kang alam sa gawaing bahay."

"Meron kaya! Marunong akong magsaing!"

Inirapan sya ng binata. "Marunong? Alin? Yung pang-isang barangay tapos hilaw pa? Aksaya ka sa bigas!"

"Matututo rin ako!" buong paninindigan nyang sabi.

"Kelan pa?"

 

"Kapag kasal na tayo!"

 

"Hindi nga tayo ikakasal."

Kinapitan niya ito sa braso at sukat yugyugin. Nangangatapon tuloy ang kape nito kaya lalo itong nainis sa kanya.

"Ano ba! Wag ngang malikot!"

"Ang sama talaga ng ugali mo! Akala ko ba mahal mo 'ko?"

"Porket mahal papakasalan agad?" taas-kilay nitong tanong.

"Dun naman talaga ang punta nun di ba? Bakit? May iba ka pang balak?" Medyo tumataas na rin ang boses ng dalaga. Nagsisimula na rin kase syang mainis kay Zelo.

Hindi na lang sumagot ang binata. He finished his coffee at saka nito kinuha ang bag.

 

"Aalis na 'ko."

 

"Pasama kase!" habol ng dalaga.

"Ni hindi ka pa nga naliligo!"

"Eh di maliligo!"

"Matagal kang maligo. Malilate ako."

"Bibilisan ko," pagpupumilit niya.

"Five minutes."

 

"Grabe! Ano yun, wisik lang? 30 minutes naman!"

 

"Bat ang tagal? Nagdadasal ka ba sa CR?!"

"Babae kaya ako!" dahilan nya.

"Sa lahat ng babae, ikaw ang pinakamabagal. Tingin mo kagusto-gusto yan? Lalong hindi kita papakasalan. Ayoko sa mabagal kumilos," tuloy-tuloy nitong sabi.

Lalong bumusangot ang dalaga.

"Sige na! 10 minutes lang..."

Tumango ito. "Sige. Oorasan kita ha. Kapag lumampas ka sa 10 minutes, iiwanan talaga kita."

 

Agad na kumaripas ng takbo ang dalaga papuntang banyo. Akala mo'y may hinahabol na deadline sa sobrang bilis maligo. Halos magkasugat-sugat na nga sya sa bilis maghilod. Tapos ay kasama rin pala sa sampung minuto ang pagbibihis at pag-aayos. Buryong-buryo na sya ng bilangan siya ni Zelo on the last minute.

Dala ang suklay ay sumunod sya dito paglabas ng apartment. Ayun, habang naglalakad sila papunta sa restaurant ay nagsusuklay siya.

 

--

 

Pagdating sa resto ay agad syang pinaupo ng binata sa sulok. Naintriga yata ang may-ari kaya tinawag ito at tinanong kung sino sya. Hindi nya marinig kung anong pinag-uusapan nila dahil medyo malayo pero alam nyang sya yun dahil patingin-tingin ang dalawa sa kanya.

One girl na tingin nya ay server din ang kumaway sa kanya. Maliit na babae ito na singkit na singkit. Simple syang ngumiti dito saka sya nagpalinga-linga ng tingin sa lugar. Maaga pa at mukhang kabubukas lang ng resto.

Mga 15 minutes siguro syang nakatunganga doon ng buksan ng may-ari ang lugar. Wala pa sigurong limang minuto ay may pumasok na isang grupo ng mga babae.

Mukhang mga estudyante rin ang mga ito dahil sa mga librong dala. All are Chinese-American.

 

Naimbyerna sya agad sa mga ito nang mahalata nyang nagpapa-cute ang mga ito kay Zelo. Ito kase ang kumuha ng order ng mga ito. Halos sampung minuto nang nakatayo si Zelo sa tabi ng table ng mga dalaga habang hindi kuno sila makapag-decide kung ano ang kakainin.

Ngali-ngali nga nyang lapitan ang mga ito kundi lang sya tiningnan ng masama ni Zelo, as if he already knew what she's thinking of doing.

Naiinis syang nagpirmi sa upuan.

 

After 20 minutes, nakuha na rin nito ang order nila at dinala sa kusina. Sunod siyang nilapitan nito. Binaliktan nito ang upuan na nasa tapat nya at naupo ito doon. He propped is elbow on the back of the chair.

"Nakasimangot ka agad umagang-umaga," puna nito.

She crossed her arms. "Nagpapalandi ka kase," nakanguso niyang sabi.

"Nagtatrabaho lang ako."

"Trabaho? Tss. Nilalandi ka na kaya! Payag na payag ka naman."

"Alam mo kumain ka na lang. Gutom lang yan. Gusto mong siopao?"

"Ayoko."

He rolled his eyes at her. "Bahala ka nga." Tumayo ito at akmang aalis nang magsalita sya ulit.

"Gusto ko lauriat. Bilisan mo, gutom na 'ko," utos niya.

 

--

 

Nauna pa ang order niya dahil nag-iisa lang sya. Pagkahatid ni Zelo ng pagkain ay pinaupo niya ito at pinipilit nyang subuan ng pagkain. Nagkape lang kase ito kaya alam niyang hindi pa ito kumakain.

Tanggi ito ng tanggi pero mapilit sya. Pilit na may kasamang pagdadabog. Kaya bago pa sya mag-tantrums ay pinagbigyan nya ito.

Hindi pa nakuntento ang dalaga. Bago niya paalisin si Zelo ay nagpahalik pa sya sa pisngi. Hindi naman sya binigo ng binata. Natatawa na lang ito sa kababawan nya.

Nang umalis ito para mag-serve sa iba ay agad niyang tiningnan kung ano'ng reaksiyon ng mga babaeng lumalandi dito kanina.

 

Pare-parehong nakataas ang kilay ng mga ito. Unable to stop the urge, dinilaan niya ang mga ito. Take that, he's mine! She wanted to say.

 

--

 

Hindi na niya inantay hanggang sa mag-out ang binata dahil bukod sa nakakasagabal sya sa pagtatrabaho nito dahil sa kakulitan nya, ay marami ring customer. Unless kakain na lang sya maghapon, she better go home.

So she went home.

Wala naman syang magawa sa bahay kaya sinubukan nyang maglilnis. But after five minutes of dusting the imaginary dust off the shelves, she quit. She ventured to the kitchen but for fear of creating fire, hindi na niya itinuloy ang balak na pagluluto.

Sumunod niyang naisipan ang paglalampaso. Tiled naman ang buong apartment kaya hindi masyadong madumi. Kumuha sya ng isang timbang tubig at basahan. Binasa niya ang pamunas at saka nagsimulang maglampaso mula sa pinakasulok ng apartment.

Sa sobrang sinop niya, kinse minutos ang nagugugol niya sa isang tile. Gumabi na't lahat ay hindi pa rin sya nangangalahati.

 

Sa may pintuan na sya naglalampaso nang dumating si Zelo. May bitbit itong hapunan para sa kanila. Bahagya itong nagulat nang makita syang nakalupasay sa semento at nagpupunas ng sahig.

"Tumayo ka nga dyan!"

Hinila sya nito patayo. "Wait! Matatapos na 'ko!"

"Nalinis ko na yan! Nagdadamsak ka lang eh."

Napasimangot na naman ang dalaga. Heto sya, tagaktak ng pawis at amoy basahan pero hindi man lang naappreciate ni Zelo yung efforts nya.

Mangiyak-ngiyak siyang nagpahid ng pawis na tumutulo sa gilid ng mukha niya.

 

"Ano? Iiyak ka na naman?" he asked.

"Ikaw kase!"

 

Bigla siya nitong niyakap. "Ang akin lang naman kase, nagpapakapagod ka lang eh hindi naman kailangan," paliwanag nito sa kanya. Saka sya nito hinalikan sa noo. "Maligo ka nga. Ang baho mo," dagdag nito.

"Mabaho ka rin noh."

Amoy pawis kase sila pareho. Parehong pang pagod at gutom.

 

Yumakap din siya dito. "Namiss talaga kita."

Hindi ito umimik.

"Ako ba hindi mo namimiss?"

Still, no response.

"Hoy sumagot ka!"

"Hindi."

"Weh?" Ayaw nyang maniwala.

"Hindi nga," pag-uulit pa ng lalaki.

 

Humiwalay siya rito. Her eyes impose questions. Lots of them.

 

"Hindi ba talaga?" malungkot nyang tanong.

 

Her eyes widened in surprise nang bigla syang halikan nito.

 

 

 

 

 

"Hindi talaga."

"Say ahhh na kase!" Pagpupumilit ng dalaga sa binata. Pareho silang kapapaligo at kasalukuyang nakaupo sa couch habang nakikinig sa TV. Nakikinig lang sila dahil hindi naman sila nanunuod. Yung takeouts kase na binili ni Zelo, dun nila binanatang kainin sa couch.

Mabuti na nga lamang at nasa malalim na takeout box ang pagkain nila. Sobrang likot kase ng dalaga at pinipillit nyang subuan ang binata kahit ayaw nito.

"Wag na nga!" Pinalis ng binata ang kamay nya. Tumilapon ang kutsara na naglalaman ng fried rice at isang tipak ng lechong kawali.

Her gaze followed the spoon and then she looked back at him. Her face contorted in anger.

"Ang arte mo!"

Tumayo ang dalaga at padabog na naglakad palayo. Zelo caught her arm though. That stopped her from walking away.

Napabuntong-hininga ang binata. "Pwede namang kumain na lang basta, di ba?" malumanay nitong tanong sa kanya.

"Nilalambing ka na nga, ayaw mo pa. Namiss lang kita," sagot niya dito. "Apparently, you don't feel the same. Sige, matutulog na lang ako." Hinatak niya ang braso mula sa binata. But he tugged it back.

"Kumain ka muna," halos ay nakikiusap nitong sabi sa kanya.

"Ayoko. Wala na 'kong gana."

 

Muli niyang hinatak ang braso mula sa binata. Pero hinatak ulit nito iyon pabalik. Sa lakas ng pagkakahatak nito sa kanya ay napaupo siya sa may kandungan nito. Dama blushed in an instant.

She was sitting sideways to him. Nagkatinginan silang dalawa.

"Kumain ka muna," pag-uulit nito.

Hindi kaagad siya nakasagot. Malumanay na kase ito. Hindi tulad kanina.

"Sorry," dagdag ng binata. Napayuko ito.

"Sorry din," she said to him.

 

"Kumain ka na," pag-uulit ulit ng binata.

Tumingin siya sa mukha nito, her eyes questioning. "Namiss mo ba 'ko?"

 

Nakatitig lamang sa kanya ang binata. Hindi ito nagsasalita.

"Zelo, sumagot ka naman!" eksasperado niyang pakiusap dito.

 

"Oo na," mahina nitong sabi.

"Lakasan mo!" she demanded.

"OO NA!" pasigaw nitong sabi.

 

Napangiti ang dalaga. "Yan! I missed you too!" she said. Dinampian niya ng halik sa pisngi ang binata at nagtatakbo papuntang kusina para kumuha ng bagong kutsara. Agad siyang bumalik sa dati niyang pwesto at nagsimulang kumaing muli. Naiiling na lamang na nagpatuloy ng pagkain ang binata.

"Oh..." udyok niya sa binata. Inilapit niya sa bibig nito ang isang kutsara ng kanin at ulam.

Tumingin ito ng masama sa kanya na ginantihan naman niya.

"Hindi ba pwedeng kumain ka na lang?" tanong ng binata.

"Hindi. Eat this," pamimilit niya dito.

 

Zelo sighed and ate the food.

 

"Ako naman," utos ng dalaga.

Zelo rolled his eyes at her. But he still did what she asked for her sake. Alam naman kase nitong mag-aaway lang sila kapag hindi niya pinagbigyan ang dalaga sa gusto nito.

 

"Thank you!" nakangiting sabi ng dalaga.

 

Naiiling na lamang na nagpatuloy ng pagkain ang binata. He adjusted para mapaharap ito sa TV. Ginaya nya ito at tumuktok din sya sa palabas. American series ang pinapanuod nila. Dexter ang title. Nabu-brutalan na nga sya pero dahil sa kalmado lang ang binata ay nanahimik na lamang sya.

Ayaw nyang masasabihan na naman na maarte sya. Kahit totoo.

 

"Zelo..." maya-maya'y panimula nya.

"Ano?" tanong nito.

"Bakit pottery ang kinuha mong course? Ang baduy ha."

"Nangingialam ka?"

 

Nilingon nya ito. "Hindi tayo mabubuhay nyan! Mag-doktor ka na lang!"

"Mayaman ka ah," sagot nito.

Tinaasan niya ito ng kilay. "Aba, ako pa talaga ang bubuhay sa 'yo?"

 

"Wag kang mag-alala, di naman kita papakasalan."

 

Napapadyak ang dalaga. "Eeeee!"

 

Tinawanan naman siya ng binata. "Bakit ba gustong gusto mong makasal sa 'kin? Wala akong pera."

Pinanlisikan nya ito. "Kase nga!"

"Ano?" nang-aasar nitong tanong sa kanya.

"Kase!"

"Ano'ng kase?" pangungulit nito.

"Tss. Secret!"

 

Ngumiti ito sa kanya. "Bat ka namumula?"

"Mainit!" mataray nyang sagot.

"Hindi kaya."

"Tseh!"

 

Tumayo ito mula sa pwesto at dumikit sa kanya.

"Bat nanlalamig ka?"

"Ice princess ako," pagdadahilan nya... kahit baduy.

 

Inakbayan siya nito. Saka siya biglang hinalikan sa pisngi. "Cute mo."

 

Agad nagkulay kamatis ang dalaga. Mas sanay kase syang sinusungitan ni Zelo. Although she likes it when he's being sweet and gentle with her, naiilang sya at nahihiya kapag ganun.

Hindi kase sya sanay pakitaan ng pagmamahal.

"Tigilan mo nga ako," halos ay pabulong nyang sabi. Hindi yata nito narinig because he went closer.

"Ano?"

"W-Wala!" She pushed him a little, scared that her erratic heart might burst out from her ribcage. Hindi naman ito nagpatalo at kinabig pa siya.

 

"Samantalahin mo na. Ngayon lang 'to," narinig nyang sabi ng binata.

"N-Ngayon lang?" Medyo nadisappoint sya sa narinig. Once in a blue moon lang magpakita ng sweetness si Zelo sa kanya. Kadalasan pa, sya yung nag-iinitiate.

Di ba pwedeng tumagal na ganoon?

 

Niluwagan nito ang pagkakayakap sa kanya.

"Sa totoo lang, namiss kita."

 

"Hindi naman yun yung tanong ko eh," she said while blushing. Pero natutuwa pa rin sya na namiss pala sya nito. Worth it ang pagsunod niya.

 

"Hindi ko ugaling maging sweet," paliwanag ng binata.

"Pero kaya mo?" tanong niya.

"Oo. Pakainin mo 'ko ng asukal."

 

"Ha. Ha."

 

"Seryoso. Di ko ugali yun," sabi nito.

"Okay lang. Masaya na 'kong ganyan ka kahit ang arte-arte mo."

 

--

 

Nearly 10PM na ng mapagpasyahan ng dalawa na matulog. Zelo settled himself on the couch while Dama rearranged the pillows on the bed.

"Huy dito ka!" sabi niya sa lalaki.

"Ayoko," sagot nito. Saka ito humarap sa sandalan ng couch.

 

Bumaba ang dalaga sa hagdanan. Nasa taas kase ang higaan ni Zelo. Malaki ang kama nito at kasya ang tatlong tao. Para syang bunk bed ang style pero ang nasa baba ay study area. Medyo mataas din ito.

Naupo sya sa tabi ng binata.

"Bat ayaw mo dun?" tanong niya dito.

"Malamang ayaw kitang katabi," sagot naman nito.

 

Nahiga ang dalaga sa tabi ng binata. Bumaling naman agad ito sa kanya ng maramdamang tinabihan niya ito.

"Dun ka na nga!" paasik nito sa kanya.

"Gusto ko tabi tayo," pagpupumilit ng dalaga.

"Tsk. Itutulak kita," banta ng binata.

"Eh di itulak mo. Iiyak ako, sige!"

 

Napahugot ng malalim na hininga ang binata bago sya nito tiningnan ng masama.

"Ang kulit mo!" iritado nitong sabi.

"Dun ka na lang kase... please?" ungot niya dito.

Zelo rolled his eyes at her. "Hala, lipat!" he said in defeat.

 

Lumipat sila pareho sa malawak na kama. Ang nakakatawa lang, nilagyan ni Zelo ng tatlong unan sa gitna nilang dalawa.

"Bakit may harang?" tanong ng dalaga.

"Delikado," simple nitong sagot.

"Bakit?" kunot-noong tanong ng dalaga. Hindi kase niya maintindihan kung anong delikado ang sinasabi ni Zelo. Matutulog lang naman sila...

 

Humarap ito sa kanya.

 

"Babae ka. Lalaki ako. 'Wag kang pakainosente dyan," sagot nito.

 

"Ano ba kaseng-" Hindi na naituloy ng dalaga ang sasabihin ng biglang naka-catch up ang utak niya sa sinasabi ng binata. "Zelo!"

He gave her a bland look. "Nagsasabi lang ako ng totoo. Matulog ka na."

 

"Payakap!"

 

He shoved a pillow at her. "Ayan. Yakapin mo."

"Ayoko nito!" reklamo niya.

 

Walang anu-ano'y biglang bumangon ang binata at bumaba sa hagdan. Sinundan naman niya ito. Pero hindi ito nag-settle ulit sa couch. Sa halip ay tumungo ito sa study area nito, naupo sa swivel chair at nagbukas ng isang drawer.

Takang minamanmanan lang niya ito.

"Naalala mo pa 'to?" tanong nito sa kanya.

 

He handed her a clip.

 

She took the clip from him. It looked familiar. Paanong hindi magiging pamilyar eh one of a kind ang clip na yun?

It was custom made for her by a world-famous accessory designer for her fourth birthday. At sa pagkakatanda niya ay inagaw iyon sa kanya ng isang batang lalaki habang naglalaro sila ng piko.

Sinubukan kase niyang makisali noon sa mga anak ng mga katulong na nakatira sa villa nila.

 

Itinulak niya yung batang lalaki, causing him to fall and thus, natigil ang laro. Mauunahan na kase sya nito. Nasa pangatlo pa lang sya ay nasa pang-apat na ito. Tanda pa niyang puro babae ang mga kalaro niya at nag-iisa pa itong lalaki.

 

"Yes, I remember."

 

"Gusto man kitang yakapin, hindi ko magawa kase baka may mangyaring hindi inaasahan. Bata pa tayo pareho at wala akong ipambubuhay sa 'yo kapag nagkataon. Kasal? Gusto rin kitang pakasalan. Pero wala akong pera," sabi nito sa kanya. "Mayaman ka. Alam mo ba kung gaano kayo kayaman? Kaya nyo yatang buhayin ang buong Pilipinas sa yaman nyo. Mahirap lang ako... kahit gusto kita, wala akong mabibigay na kahit ano sa 'yo."

"Hindi mo naman kelangang magbigay ng kahit ano eh."

"Lalaki ako. Natural na sa 'kin na isipin na kailangan kong ibigay ang lahat sa isang babae. Pero sa estado ng buhay ko ngayon? Ni pagkain ng tatlong beses sa isang araw, baka hindi ko maibigay sa 'yo. Alam mo bang simula pagkabata tinitingnan na kita ng palihim? At araw-araw parang lalo kong nare-realize na hindi ako para sa 'yo. Gustong-gusto kita pero hindi kita malapitan. Hindi kase tayo bagay."

"Bakit ba palagi mo na lang sinasabing hindi tayo bagay? Wala ka na bang ibang pwedeng idahilan sa 'kin?!"

 

Hindi agad nakasagot ang binata.

 

"Zelo, if you would always think that, pano ka sasaya? You guys taught me to accept things as they are and learn from them. I adapted. Naghirap ako di ba? Tinanggap ko yun. Sumaya ako. Why can't you do the same?" Nang hindi pa rin makasagot ang binata ay nagpatuloy siya, "Walang mali sa ating dalawa. Hindi langit at lupa ang pagitan natin. You can reach me and I can reach you. You just have to accept that."

 

Nagkatinginan silang dalawa na para bang nagsusukatan kung sino ang mas tama.

 

In the end, sumuko ang binata. He sighed. "Sige na. Nakumbinsi mo na 'ko," he said in defeat.

Ngumiti sya. "Talaga?"

Tumango ito.

"You'll marry me someday then?"

"Pag may pera."

 

"That's good enough."

 

"Isa pa pala," pahabol nito. She was about to return to the bed to sleep ng magsalita ito ulit.

"Ano?"

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"Hindi Zelo ang pangalan ko."

Come on bitch. You don't know how I feel seeing you around still breathing.

--

 

 "Zelo!" 

 

She hugged him from behind. Kinukulit nya kase ito habang nagluluto ito ng agahan nila. Maya-maya ay papasok na naman ito sa school. Maiiwan na naman syang mag-isa sa bahay.

"Sabi nang hindi Zelo ang pangalan ko," he said.

"Eh kahit na. Mas gusto ko pa rin yung name mo na yun. Mas gwapo."

 

Natawa ito sa sinabi nya. "Mas gwapo? LOL. Lumayo ka nga at naiinitan ako."

"Pakiss muna!" Dama loosened her embrace, tiptoed behind him and kissed his cheek. Saka sya nagpunta sa sala para manuod ng TV.

 

Maya-maya pa ay natapos nang magluto ang binata. He laid the food on the table while she helped in getting the plates and utensils. Kung titingnan from an outsider's point of view, animo'y young married couple ang dalawa. 

When he moves, she'd somehow react unconsciously. It's like pulling a string na nakakabit sa dalawa.

"Kain na," sabi ng binata sa kanya.

"Magtitimpla lang ako ng kape. Want one Zelo?" nakangiti niyang tanong. Sinasadya ng dalagang tawagin Zelo ang binata. Pang-asar lang.

Natutuwa kase sya sa dahilan nito kung bakit Zelo ang sinabi nitong pangalan sa kanya dati.

 

"Bakit Zelo?" tanong niya kagabi ng sabihin nito ang tunay nitong pangalan.

"Naisip ko kase dati na 0% chance lang ang meron ako sa 'yo. Naalala ko naman nung naalala ko yun na hindi ko mabigkas yung mga words na may R ng tama. Pangalan ko nga dati, Pielle ang pagkakabigkas ko. Kapag nagbibilang ako ng numbers, pinagtatawanan ako ng mga kaklase ko... lalo na kapag zero, three at four yung binibigkas ko," paliwanag nito sa kanya.

Nginitian nya ito. "Ang cute naman. So Zelo came from zero?" Tumango ito. "Mas type ko naman yun kesa sa Pierre Alessander. Mouthful masyado pero walang dating."

"Sige, laitin mo pa ang pangalan ko."

"And yung surname mo! Papaltan mo nga! Balutan, really? Gawin kaya nating Wrapper para masaya?" pang-aasar niya sa binata.

He gave her a dead stare. "Matulog ka na nga. Bangag ka na."

"Ayoko pa!" reklamo ng dalaga. "Kwentuhan muna tayo."


Pasado ala-una ng madaling araw pero hindi pa sila natutulog na dalawa. Nakahiga lamang sila pareho sa kama, magkaharapan at nagkikwentuhan. Nasa gitna pa rin ang mga unan na inilagay ni Zelo--Pierre--sa pagitan nila.

Tinalikuran sya ng binata. "May pasok ako bukas."

"Grabe, uuwi na 'ko sa isang araw pero hindi pa tayo nakakapag-date!" reklamo ng dalaga.

"Wala akong pera," sagot ng binata.

"Ayan ka na naman eh!"

"Totoo kase. Matulog ka na lang."




"Payakap!" she demanded.

 

Hinarap siya ng binata. Saka sya nito hinila palapit dito. May nakaharang pa ring unan.

"Ang KJ," nakasimangot niyang sabi.

 

"Dami mong reklamo. Matulog ka na lang."

"Kiss!" she demanded again. Agad naman itong lumapit to give her a peck.

"Good night," sabi nito pagkatapos at saka ito pumikit.

 

--

 

The day after tomorrow, Zelo skipped his class para maihatid siya sa airport. Halos ayaw niya nang bumitaw sa binata dahil magkakalayo na naman sila... kakikita pa lang nila eh!

"Kelan ka ba uuwi?" tanong niya sa binata.

"Baka sa July," sagot nito.

"July pa?! January pa lang ngayon ah!"

"Mabilis lang yun," pagkakalma nito sa kanya.

"Ilang buwan din yun! Saka hindi ka uuwi sa birthday mo?"

"Para saan pa eh wala naman akong panghanda."

 

"Ipaghahanda kita," mabilis na sabi ng dalaga.

"Wag na."

"Uwi ka na! Sige na please?"

 

Zelo rolled his eyes at her. "Ang kulit mo rin eh noh? Sige na. Susubukan ko."

"Kapag hindi ka umuwi, ipapa-drop ko lahat ng subjects mo!" banta niya.

"Sama mo. Alis na nga."

 

Itinulak sya nito. Sumimangot siya. "Grabe, ang sweet mo talaga kahit kelan!"

 

"Umuwi ka na para mamiss kita. Uwi na dali," pagtataboy nito sa kanya.

"Goodbye kiss?"

"Wala. Di na uso yun."

"Eeee..." pag-aalboroto ng dalaga.

 

Natawa ang binata at hinila siya sa braso. "Goodbye hug na lang." Niyakap siya nito. "Saka na ang kiss kapag nagpakabait ka."

Magrereklamo pa sana ang dalaga ng bigla namang marinig niya ang flight number niya. Yes sadly, she has to commute back to the Philippines dahil ang jet ay hiniram ng kanyang daddy for his business trip abroad.

Niyakap niya ng mahigpit si Zelo bago nya ito tuluyang pakawalan.

 

"I'll miss you," sambit niya.

"Oo na. Mamimiss din kita," sagot nito sa kanya.

"Umuwi ka sa birthday mo ha!"

"Pag may pera."

"Papadalhan kita."

"Ayoko."

 

Napabuntong-hininga ng malalim ang dalaga. "Bahala ka. Pupuntahan kita kapag hindi ka umuwi."

"Eh di puntahan."

 

Her flight was announced again. She looked at Zelo for the last time before leaving. Kinawayan nya ito nang may kaakibat na pagngiti.

"Bye Zelo! I'll see you soon!"

"Best!" salubong sa kanya ni Eula. Nasa airport ang barkada at mga naka-school uniform pa. Mukhang sinabi ng mommy nya sa mga ito na darating sya.

"Kaya pala makulimlim, nandito ka na," Lei said to her. Inirapan nya ito at napatingin sya sa glass walls ng airport. Makulimlim nga...

"Inaaway nyo 'ko?" taas kilay nyang tanong. Pinamay-awangan nya ang mga kaibigan. "Sige, wala kayong pasalubong."

 

"Joke lang! 'To naman," bawi agad ni Lei.

"Welcome back nga di ba? Natutuwa kaming nandito ka na naman sa Pilipinas," dagdag ni Keeme.

 

She rolled her eyes at them. "Basta talaga pasalubong ang bibilis nyo eh noh?"

 

Nagtawanan ang barkada at kanya-kanya silang kuha ng mga dala niyang naka-trolley.

"Ano ba kayo, hayaan nyo na yung mga katulong dyan," pigil nya sa mga ito.

Isa-isang ibinalik ng barkada ang mga gamit na kinuha nila sa trolley. Napansin ng dalaga si Chastene na nasa isang sulok at nakapanuod lang sa kanila.

"Uy Chas, nandyan ka pala?"

She gave her a timid smile. "Welcome back Miss," bati nito sa kanya.

"Thanks. Dito ka nga." Pinalapit niya ito sa barkada. Napangiti siya nang makitang biglang nailang si Eli. "Hoy Elijah... kalma."

Napanguso naman si Eli. Chastene's face lacked reaction. Parang wala lang dito.

"Miss, lampas 1 month na," sabi nito sa kanya.

"Ha?" taka niyang tanong.

"Di ba sabi mo, one month lang tayong friends?" pagpapaalala nito sa kanya.

Nagkatinginan ang magbabarkda. Nilapitan niya ito. "Well, if you want to, you can tag along. Since kulang naman kami ngayon ng isa, ikaw na lang muna ang kapalit nya."

Lumapit rin si Eula kay Chastene at inakbayan ito. Saka ito tumingin sa kanya. "Best naman. Tag along? Bat di ba i-welcome sa barkada?"

"That's what I mean," sagot niya. "If that's okay with her," dagdag niya nang nakaturo kay Chastene.

"Okay lang," sagot ng dalaga.

"Then we're all okay. Let's give her a welcome hug, shall we?" nakangising sabi niya.

"Isa-isa?" Lei suggested.

"Why not?" She went on to hug Chastene. Sumunod naman sina Eula, Keeme at Lei.

 

"Eli, ikaw na," tudyo nila sa kabarkada.

"Kailangan pa talaga?" nahihiya nitong tanong.

"Dali na! Wag kang KJ!" they demanded.

Napasimangot si Eli saka mabilisang niyakap si Chastene without even looking at her. Tapos ay bumitaw din sya agad.

"Tara na umuwi," sabi nito saka naglakad palabas ng airport. Nagtawanan naman sila at sumunod na dito palabas.

 

--

 

Naghanda ang mga katulong ng pagkain para sa pagdating niya. Kumpleto silang lahat sa isang mesa.

"How's North Carolina sweetie?"

"It's nice ma. Not as nice as New York though," sagot niya sa ina.

"Kumusta naman kayo ni Zelo?" tanong ni Lei.

At the mention of Zelo's name ay agad syang napangiti. "Kami na," she announced to them.

"Ayeeee... kaya naman pala ang ganda-ganda ng mood mo," puna ni Eula.

"Kelan daw ba sya uuwi?" tanong ni Lei sa kanya.

"Birthday nya," sagot niya.

"Eh di ba Valentine's Day yun?"

"Oo."

"Ayeee... eh di may date kayo?"

Lalong lumapad ang ngiti nya. Naiisip pa lang nya ang mangyayari pag-uwi ni Zelo, kinikilig na sya.

 

Bigla tumayo ang daddy nya.

"Dad, tapos ka na?" asked her mom.

Tumango lang ito at umalis. After her dad left, nagkatinginan silang mag-ina.

"What?" she asked her mom.

"Nagtatampo yun for sure."

"Bakit na naman? What did I do?" reklamo nya.

Her mom shrugged. "Beats me. Tanungin mo kaya?"

 

She grunted and then stood up. Sinundan nya ang daddy niya sa study nito.

"Dad?" She peeked at the door. Nakita niyang nakatayo ang daddy niya sa may bintana ng room. Nakapamay-awang ito at mukhang malalim ang iniisip. Nilapitan niya ito. "Daddy?"

Napabuntong-hininga ang ama niya.

"What's the matter?" she asked.

"Nothing..."

She hugged his waist. "Come on daddy. Meron eh. What is it?"

Her dad held her face with both his hands and then sighed. "Dalaga ka na anak."

She laughed at his statement. "Syempre naman dad. I can't stay young forever."

"Few years from now, ikakasal ka na."

"Dad..."

Sumimangot si Daniel. "Are you really sure you're in love? You're too young..."

"Daddy, I am. And what's wrong with that? It's not as if I'm going to get married next week. In love lang ako. Normal naman yun di ba?"

"Sa 'yo hindi," sagot ng daddy nya.

"Last mo na yan daddy ha."

 

Tumawa ito at niyakap sya. Sa tangkad ng daddy nya, naipatong pa nito ang baba nito sa ulo nya.

"I'm losing my baby girl..."

"You're so dramatic dad. May isa pa namang baby si mommy. Kung gusto nyo, gawa pa kayo ulit," biro nya sa ama. Natawa naman ito.

"Sira. We're not as young as before, you know. Hinay-hinay din."

"Sus. Ang tatanda nyo na nga ang lalandi nyo pa eh."

 

"Ano kayong mag-ama? Di na kakain?" narinig nilang tanong ng mommy nya. Nasa may pintuan ito at naghihintay sa kanila.

 

"Babalik na po," sagot niya.

 

--

 

Dahil walang magawa ang dalaga, napagpasyahan niyang bumalik sa pang-mahirap na school na minsan ay naging paaralan niya. She decided to pay a visit to her friends... kasama si Chastene syempre... para kay Eli.

Sa bungad pa lang ng school ay nakakuha na ng atensyon ang dalaga. Ikaw ba naman kase ang bihis mayaman at may magarang kotse, bodyguards at mga katulong na kasama?

May tagapayong sila ng kaibigan nyang si Chastene. Both have bodyguards.

Literal na nahawi ang daan sa pagdaan nila.

 

Nagulat ang mga dati niyang kaklase upon her arrival. Natuwa naman ang mga kabarkada niya. They were all excused from class. Naglalakad ang magbabarkada papuntang cafeteria ng makasalubong nila ang grupo nina Tassie.

Masamang-masama ang tingin nito sa kanya pero dahil meron syang kasamang bodyguards ay nag-give way ito. She smirked at Tassie.

"Hey Tassie, good to see you're still alive. Magsa-summer na ah. 'Wag kang masyadong maglalabas. Baka matunaw ka."

"Bakit bumalik ka pa? Para ipamukha sa lahat na mayaman ka? Oh yan... pinagtitinginan ka na. Masaya ka na?" nang-uuyam nitong tanong sa kanya.

"Ay bitter teh? O eto Gucci, pampalubag loob." Iniabot niya dito ang hawak nyang bag na walang laman kundi yung makeup kit niya.

"Pwede ba! Kaya ko ring bumili nyan!" iritado nitong sabi.

"Tinatanggihan ang grasya? Ikaw," she pointed at Megumi. "Gusto mo? Dali... I'm feeling generous today."

Nag-aalangang tumingin si Megumi kay Tassie. Umirap naman ito.

"Ano? Nangangalay ako ha."

 

Agad na kinuha ni Meg ang bag mula sa kamay niya. "Thank you," mahina nitong sabi.

"Social climber ka talaga! Nabigyan ka lang ng bag, bumaliktad ka na? Turncoat!" bulyaw dito ni Tassie.

Mukhang nairita si Meg sa sinabi nito. "At least ako hindi plastic! At least ako, kapag ayoko sinasabi ko. Eh ikaw? Kunwari ka pang mabait, nasa loob naman ang kulo! At isa pa, ang baho ng hininga mo! Mag-tooth brush ka nga!"

Biglang sinampal ni Tassie si Meg. Naka-attract na ng atensyon ang dalawa dahil sa hallway sila nagbangayan. Tumabi sina Dama at hinarangan naman sila ng mga guards na kasama.

Gumanti ng sampal si Meg.

 

Maya-maya pa'y nakisali na ang ibang kaibigan ng dalawa. Nagsabunutan na sila.

 

"Uy ano'ng gagawin natin?" nag-aalalang tanong ni Eli.

"Manunuod. Sayang walang popcorn," she answered blandly.

"Eh di naglabasan ang mga tunay na kulay," dagdag ni Lei.

"Grabe bad breath nga yang si Tassie. Nagkiss na kaya sila ni Zelo?" tanong ni Eula.

Napa-"ewww" silang sabay-sabay.

"God! I hope not!" nandidiri niyang sabi. "Tara na nga! Ang papangit nila para panuorin." She started walking and was eventually followed by her friends.

 

Habang papunta sila sa cafeteria ay isa na namang familiar face ang nakita nila.

"Uy... di ba si Oliver yun?" tanong ni Keeme sabay turo sa isang lalaking naglalakad ng nakangiti.

"Oo nga noh? Ano na naman kayang ginagawa nun dito?" tanong naman ni Eula.

 

Like her, Oliver seemed to be a different person. Mas maporma na ito. Simpleng navy blue shirt na v-neck at medyo hapit sa katawan na napapatungan ng isang sky blue scarf na nakaikot sa leeg nito. Gray ang kulay ng jeans na medyo pakupas ang style at naka-combat boots na kulay black.

Naka-shades din ito kahit hindi masyadong maaraw.

 

"HOY OLIVER!" malakas na tawag niya sa binata. Napalingon naman ito agad sa kanila. When he recognized her ay agad itong ngumiti at lumapit sa kanila.

"Yo!"

"Yo your face! Bakit nandito ka? Are you stalking me?" naka-pamay-awang nyang tanong.

"Excuse me?" taas-kilay na tanong ng binata. "Nauna ako sa 'yo dito. Wag kang makapal ang mukha."

"Eh bakit ka ba kase nandito? Hindi ka nag-aaral di ba?" tanong nya. Olli stopped schooling because of his acting career. Mahirap kaseng pagsabayin dahil sa buhol-buhol na schedule.

Hindi sikat si Olli sa Pilipinas. He started acting in Thailand and Korea kase. When he went to back to the Philippines two years ago, walang masyadong nakakakilala dito. Hindi naman kase ito ganun kasikat. So when the opportunity presented itself, tinanggap nito agad.

Bibigyan daw kase ito ng break sabi ni Author... if he do what she's asking him to do.

 

Ngayon ay iniintay pa nito ang break na yun.

 

"May dinadalaw lang ako," sagot nito sa kanya.

Tumaas ang kilay ng dalaga. "Really? Who?"

"Classmate ko," maikli nitong sagot.

"Yang ngiting yan... classmate lang ba talaga?" naiintrigang tanong ni Eula na napansing kanina pa hindi mawala ang ngiti ng binata.

"Well technically, Joana's my classmate."

"Yeeee... sinong Joana yan?" tanong ni Lei.

"Yung pinanlaban ng department namin nung Intrams," Olli answered proudly.

"Wow... chicks yun pre!" manghang sabi ni Eli.

 

Lalong lumapad ang ngiti ni Olli. "Syempre. Gwapo ako eh."

"Ang hangin talaga." Dama rolled her eyes.

"Gwapo naman."

"Ugh. Oo na. Gwapo ka na. Kasuka yang kayabangan mo," naiirita nyang sabi.

"Ayeeee.... LQ," tudyo ni Eula.

 

"May balikan bang magaganap?" natatawang tanong ni Eli.

 

Parehas silang tumingin ng masama sa dalawa.

"Joke lang. HB kayo masyado."

 

"Maiba ako, bakit ka nandito?" tanong ni Olli sa kanya.

"Wala. Tinatamad ako sa school ko," sagot nya.

"Si Zelo asan?" tanong ulit nito.

"Asa North Carolina."

"Really? Mayaman pala sya," Olli concluded.

 

"No. Kami ang mayaman," pagtatama nya. "Paaral sya ni mommy."

"Oh... sige. Nakakatamad ka ng kausap. I'll go ahead," paalam nito.

 

She scoffed. "Excuse me! Mas nakakatamad kang kausap!"

Olli laughed. "Chill."

 

"Uy Olli!"

 

Lahat sila ay napatingin sa tumawag. Kumakaway ang isang magandang babae mula sa di kalayuan. Si Joana... or JM as she is more commonly known. Panlaban ito sa halos lahat ng pageant sa school. Maganda kase ito. Simple lang at hindi mahilig mag-makeup pero sobrang ganda naman kapag inayusan.

Matalino rin ito at crowd favorite dahil witty sumagot ng questions.

"Hi JM!" Todo kaway yung dalawa ni Eli at Keeme. Si Olli naman ay nilapitan ito at kinawayan sila bago ito tuluyang umalis kasama si Joana.

"Nanliligaw na kaya yung mokong na yun?" tanong ni Lei.

"Asa ka. Sa sobrang kayabangan nun? Nah... I highly doubt it. Nambobola pa siguro."

 

"May patutunguhan ba 'tong usapan natin? Nagugutom na 'ko," reklamo ni Keeme.

 

"Ayoko pala sa cafeteria nyo. Pangit ang lasa ng mga pagkain. Balik na lang tayo sa bahay," sabi nya sa mga ito.

"Hindi kaya sawang-sawa na sa 'min ang parents mo? Palagi kaming nandun eh," tanong ni Eula sa kanya.

"Hindi yun. Saka dun na din kayo this weekend ha? I'll prepare a party for Pierre. Malapit na kase ang birthday nya."

 

"Pierre?" sabay-sabay na tanong ng mga ito.

"Oh sorry... you don't know pa pala. For Zelo."

 

"Ha?"

"Sino si Pierre?"

"Di ba si Olli yun?"

 

She sighed. "Mygosh... ganto kase... Zelo is not really Zelo."

 

"HA?!"

 

"Zelo is Pierre. Pierre Alessander err-Balutan."

 

xxxx

AN: 

So this is dedicated to ate Pepay dahil ayokong gumawa ng labletter. Pauso nya yun eh. Hahaha... Sa mga nagtatanong at nagtataka, prends na po kami ni Ate Pepay. Hindi po kami nagpaplastikan. Sadyang pareho lang kaming marunong tumanggap ng pagkakamali, marunong mag-sorry at marunong makipag-reconcile. Civil kami eh... kayo ba?

Salamat sa mga mababait na nag-comfort sa 'kin. Di ko na kayo babanggitin isa-isa kase baka may makalimutan ako eh magtampo pa. Basta alam nyo na kung sino kayo.

Thank you. :) 

 PS. Joana or JM is ATeddyLover here in Watty na haling na haling kay Olli. :>

"Ang sweet ng parents mo noh?"

 

Pinapanuod nilang magbabarkada mula sa mataas na terrace ng kwarto nya ang parents nya na nasa garden. Her room was at the east room, para matatamaan sya ng morning sunlight. Dyma's was on the west room because he prefers the sunset... or that's what she wanted to think. Ayaw kase nyang maguilty. Originally kase, room ni Dyma itong kwarto nya. Pinalipat lang nya ang kapatid dahil gusto nyang nakikita nya araw-araw ang sunrise.

Perfect view kase.

 

Nasa garden ang parents nya that afternoon. Magkahawak ang kamay na naglalakad-lakad. Until now, she can't quite understand why her father loves her mother so much. Kahit ang tagal ng mag-asawa nito at may dalawa nang anak ay wala pa ring makapantay sa sweetness ng dalawa.

"Kung sweet ang parents mo best, san ka nagmana?" tanong ni Eula sa kanya.

"Oo nga. Sobrang bitter mo kase eh. Ampon ka ba?" tudyong tanong naman ni Keeme.

 

She glared at both. "Ang sama sama nyo talaga!" singhal nya sa dalawa.

 

Nagtawanan ang barkada. "Pero nakakakilig talaga ang daddy mo best. Ang gwapo gwapo pa!"

"Hey... off-limits ang daddy ko," banta nya sa kaibigan.

"Joke lang! May Jairus na 'ko noh..."

Lei rolled her eyes at her sister's remark.

"Jairus ka ng Jairus, nandyan naman si Keeme," sabat ni Eli.

"Nah! 'Wag na!" reklamo ni Eula.

"Uy si Chastene nao-OP," untag ni Lei sa kanila. Napatingin silang lahat kay Chastene na nasa isang sulok.

 

Siniko ni Dama si Eli na katabi niya. "Kausapin mo kaya."

Siniko siya nitong pabalik. "Eh di ikaw."

"Ayeee... si Eli nahihiya!" tudyo nila sa barkada.

"Ako na naman ang nakita nyo," nakanguso nitong reklamo.

"Tabihan mo kase si Chastene nang hindi ma-OP," sabi ni Lei dito.

 

Lumipat sina Eula at Keeme sa tabi kabilang side ni Chastene. Si Lei naman ay lumipat sa tabi ni Dama. Pinagitnaan nila yung dalawa.

 

--

 

Eli shivered when his elbow touched Chastene's. Nagka-crush na naman siya dati pero hindi tulad nito na natatameme sya. He finds Chastene cute kase. The kind of cute that would bring you a burst of happiness whenever you look at them.

She looked bubbly even though she's not smiling at all times.

Kakaiba... that's what it feels like. Kakaiba na magaan sa pakiramdam.

 

--

 

Napatingin ang mag-asawa sa magbabarkada na nagtatawanan sa terrace.

"She looks so happy..." Meg said to Dani.

"I know... who'd have thought, right?"

"I actually did something good."

He kissed her hair. "Yeah, you did. Hindi ka nangangalay mommy? Don't you want to sit?" he asked in concern.

"Medyo nga dad. Upo muna tayo."

 

He nodded and they went to the gazebo. That gazebo was patterned after the movie A Cinderella Story which starred Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray. Meg liked the look and feel of the gazebo so she asked him to build her one.

Well, technically, he did not build it but he asked a friend to build it for them. An architect named Jansen... who also happened to be Dyma's godfather.

Jealousy? Meg and Dani will never get past that. Both were just a teeny tiny bit possessive and obsessed of each other... but all is well between Sen and Dani.

Trust... it was hard earned and got lost along the way, but they found it again and took care of it.

Love? It will never leave their hearts. Or at least that's the hope.

 

"I hope that guy won't break my sweetie's heart," he said out of the blue, while looking at his daughter.

"No he won't. I know that kid well. He has a good heart," Meg assured him.

"I still don't want her to get married though. Siguro mga after 10 years pa."

"Sobra ka naman dad. Tayo nga early 20s ikinasal eh."

"Iba naman ang panahon nun ma," pagdadahilan nya.

Tumaas ang kilay ni Meg. "Oh? How so?"

"Walang internet," seryosong sagot ni Dani.

 

"Sira ka talaga," natatawang sabi ni Meg.

 

Ngumiti na lamang si Dani and then he planted a kiss on Meg's lips.

 

--

 

"Ay! Nagkiss!" Eula exclaimed.

Dama grunted saka sya tumalikod mula sa view ng parents nya. "Wag nyo ngang tingnan!" nahihiya nyang sabi sa mga kaibigan.

"Bakit naman? Ang sweet nga ng parents mo eh. Bihira na yang ganyan."

"Likas lang talaga sa kanila yang landian na yan," she pointed out.

"Inggit ka lang eh."

 

"Oy excuse me! Pag-uwi ni Zelo makikita nyo... mas sweet pa kami kina mommy!"

 

Natawa ang barkada sa tinuran nya.

"Si Zelo, sweet? Kahit pakainin mo ng isang kilong asukal yun, hindi yun magiging sweet!"

"Tama! Saka maarte yun."

"Isusumbong ko kayo pag-uwi nya!" banta niya sa mga ito.

"Sumbong mo. Takot namin?" nakangising tanong ni Lei.

She grunted again. "Sweet kaya yun," pagtatanggol nya sa boyfriend.

"Whatever. Eh teka nga pala... sabi mo hindi Zelo pangalan nya di ba?"

She nodded. "Pierre Alessander...Balutan. Yuck sa last name!"

 

Nagtawanan sila. "At least maganda ang first name, di ba?"

"Pano na lang kapag kinasal kami? Can you imagine what my name would sound like? Danielle Marie Dirham Balutan. I'm betting that people won't be able to say my name with a straight face!"



Lalo silang natawa sa kaartehan ng dalaga. "Bagay nga kayo! Ang arte nyo pareho!"

Sinimangutan nya ang mga ito. "Gee thanks. True friends talaga kayo eh," she said with sarcasm.

Inakbayan sya ni Keeme. "Gusto mo tayo na lang ang magpakasal. Danielle Marie Dirham Astel... oh di ba? Maganda," nakangiti nitong sabi.

Pinalis niya ang kamay nito. "Tigil-tigilan mo nga ako KJ!"

"Ano Keeme? Bukas si Chastene naman? Maawa ka kay Eli! NGSB yan!" Lei said.

Napasimangot si Eli. "Ako na naman!" reklamo nito.

"Uy Chastene magsalita ka naman," untag ni Eula sa dalaga na katabi ni Eli.

Ngumiti naman ito. "Nakakahiyang makisali eh."

"Ano ka ba, wag kang mahiya! Mga walanghiya kami, dapat ikaw din."

Natawa ito sa sinabi ni Keeme. "Walanghiya talaga?"

 

"Oy oy! Di ba may initiation sa newbie?" tanong ni Lei sa kanila.

"Oo nga! Tara sa kusina dali!"

 

Nagsitakbuhan ang magbabarkada papunta sa malawak na kusina ng mga Dirham. Nakapanuod lamang ang mga katulong na nagluluto ng hapunan nang kumuha ang dalaga ng isang slice ng cake mula sa ref at saka niya iyon inilagay sa gitna ng table.

Nasa tigkabilang side ang magbabarkada. Kagaya ng ginawa sa kanya ng mga ito, isa-isa silang sumubo ng cake gamit ang kutsara in the same order as before.

Ngayon nga lang ay wala si Zelo.

"Two times akong kakain. For Zelo," she said to them.  Hindi na nakareklamo ang mga ito dahil isinubo na nya ang pangalawang kuha nya ng cake.

Next, she took another bite size with the fork and gave it to Chastene.

"Pag di mo yan kinain, aawayin ka namin," banta nito sa dalaga.

 

Agad namang kinuha ni Chastene ang tinidor at saka isinubo ang cake. Saka ito ngumiti sa kanila. Surprise was evident on the maids' faces. Naiiling na ibinalik ng mga ito ang atensiyon sa pagluluto.

"Ate Sally, eto na yung kalamansi," narinig niyang sabi ng isang bata. Si Meera.

"Uy Meera!" tawag niya dito.

"Magandang gabi po," magalang nitong sagot.

"Uy bata! Kumusta na?" tanong ni Eli.

"Okay naman po," nakangiti nitong sagot.

 

"Gusto mo ng cake?"

Umiling ito.

"Come on. 'Wag ka nang mahiya. Ikukuha kita, okay?" she insisted.

Tumango-tango naman ito.

 

Inilabas niya mula sa ref ang cake na mga tatlong slice pa lang ang bawas. Then she asked the maids for small plates and forks. Sakto naman na naghihiwa sya ng cake nang pumasok ng kusina si Dyma.

"Gusto mo ng cake?" tanong niya dito.

"Sure," sagot nito. Naupo si Dyma sa tabi ni Meera. "Hello," bati nito sa bata.

"Hello po."

 

"Why are you eating cake? Magdi-dinner na ah?"

 

 

 

"Gusto nyo mommy?" patay-malisya nyang tanong sa ina na kakapasok din sa kusina kasama ang daddy nya.

"No," tanggi nito. "Mamaya na kayo kumain. Matatapos na silang magluto."

Halos sabay-sabay na nagbaba ng fork na isusubo na sana ang magkakaibigan. They pushed the plates away.

"Sally, luto na ba yan?" tanong ng mommy nya sa katulong.

"Yes ma'am," sagot nito.

"Sige, maghain na kayo."

 

The maids obliged and prepared the table. Masayang kumain ang mag-anak kasama ang mga kaibigan niya. And since na marami pang libreng upuan, pinasabay na rin nila sa kanila ang mga katulong na nagluto.

After that, she and her friends headed to her room para ituloy ang kwentuhan.

 

--

 

"Bakit daw Zelo?" tanong ni Eula sa kanya.

"Kase utal sya sa R nung bata sya. So zero became Zelo... eh yun na lang ang ginamit nya."

"Alam ng parents mo?"

She nodded. "My mom knew from the very beginning. Kilala daw sya ang father ni Zelo eh. They met once at EDSA."

"Ex?" natatawang tanong ni Lei.

"Ex-holdaper ang tatay ni Zelo."

"Eeee?"

 

She nodded. "Absurd, right? But she said that he only did that to save Zelo. He was dying at that time kase and the hospital won't perform the operation kapag walang down payment."

"Ay grabe naman!"

"Yeah. We sued the hospital when we learned na ganun ang kalakaran nila kahit sa ibang pasyente."

 

"Ang bait ng mommy mo Miss," Chastene said.

"Don't Miss me, Chas. We're friends now. My friends don't call me miss. 'Sides, mabait talaga si mommy. Mana ako sa kanya eh."

"Weh..." they chorused in obvious skepticism.

"Totoo naman eh. Mabait kaya ako!" she said in defense.

 

"Siguro deep down."

"Mga six feet under."

"Mga bikini botton deep."

 

Tawanan.

 

Kahit sya hindi nya magawang mainis sa banat ng mga kaibigan.

"Teka, balik tayo sa topic. Will Zelo be okay with a huge party?" tanong nya sa mga ito.

Umiling sina Keeme, Eli, Eula at Lei. Si Chastene ay tahimik lang.

 

"As much as possible nga eh 'wag ka nang magpa-party. Maiirita lang yun," Lei suggested.

"Tama, sasabihin na naman nun, gastos lang."

"Pakialam ba nya? Pera ko naman ang gagastusin ko eh."

"Nagtanong ka pa? Ikaw rin naman pala ang masusunod," Keeme retorted.

"Eh gifts? What will he like?"

 

"Ayaw nya rin ng regalo."

She rolled her eyes. "Come on! It's his birthday, he might want something?"

Nagsi-ilingan sila. "Hindi naman kase materialistic yung taong yun eh."

"Pero wala talaga syang gusto?" kunot-noo nyang tanong.

 

Umiling ang mga ito.

 

She grunted. "Ang hirap naman!"

"Mahirap talaga," pag-agree ni Eula.

"Eh ano dapat ang iregalo ko? I can't not give him anything..." she asked in dilemma.

"Isip ka best. Something from the heart," sabi ni Eula.

 

She sighed.

"Mahirap yun Dama," Lei joked. She glared at her friend.

"Dumadali ka na naman Analeigh."

Tumawa ito.

"Manuod na nga lang tayo ng movie. Ano'ng gusto nyo?"

 

"G.I. Joe 2!"

"Must Be Love na lang!"

"Baduy! Iron Man!"

"Ayy! Wag yun! Pangit ang bida! Korean movie na lang!"

 

She rolled her eyes at them. "Ako na lang ang pipili," she said to them.

 

"Ano yan? Mean Girls?"

 

Tawanan. "Haha. Last mo na yan Analeigh." She chose the movie Wreck-It Ralph from the movie folders. Yung TV kase nila is a smart TV. PC and television in one. Touch-screen pa!

Kaya naman hindi mapigilang makidutdot nina Eli at Keeme.

 

When the movie started playing, nagpaalam muna sa kanila ang dalaga. "I'll go get some popcorns."

"Pasama." Tumayo din si Keeme at sumunod sa kanya.

 

--

 

Nadaanan nila sa sala ang parents niya. Nanunuod ang mga ito ng TV. Meg was cuddled on Dani's arms. Nainggit na naman sya. Gusto nya kaseng ganun din ka-sweet sa kanya si Zelo. Kaso, asa naman sya. He'll never be as sweet as her dad.

He's sweet in his own way though.

 

Pumasok silang dalawa ni Keeme sa kusina. She took the kernels out the fridge and poured them on a platter, blanketed them with aluminum foil and popped them in the microwave.

"Magtimpla kaya ako ng juice?" tanong nya dito.

 

"May sasabihin ako."

 

Nilingon nya ito. "Oh? You want cheese o barbeque?" she asked.

 

 

 

 

 

"Dama gusto kita."

AN: Kalma ulit ha. Hehe... naadik ako sa Wreck-It Ralph. Will watch it again some time. *u*

You speak shit? Coincidentally, I don't like hearing them. Shut up.

"Dama gusto kita."

 

The popcorns started popping. Agad na pinatay ng dalaga ang microwave at saka maingat na inilabas ang popcorns.

"Keeme, quit the joke, okay? Hindi na nakakatawa."

"Pano kung gusto talaga kita?" seryosong tanong nito sa kanya.

She sighed and looked him in the eye. "I don't care if you like me. I don't like you like that," deretsahan nyang sagot.

"Alam ko naman eh. Si Zelo ang gusto mo... kahit ako pa ang unang nakakilala sa 'yo."

 

Kumunot ang noo ng dalaga. "What do you mean?"

 

"Naaalala mo ba nung sinabi ko sa inyo na alam kong hindi talaga kayo magpinsan? Sa totoo lang, matagal ko ng alam. Hindi ko lang sinasabi sa kanila dahil masaya akong malapit ka sa 'kin. Matagal na kitang kilala. High school pa lang ako, kilala na kita. Nakikita kita sa magazines na binibili ni mama. Palagi kang nasa centerfold. Sa inyo yata yung magazine na yun eh. Featured ang pamilya ninyo.

Ikaw at ang mommy ang palaging laman ng women's section. Noon pa lang... gusto na kita.

Gusto ko yung mataba mong pisngi. Gusto ko yung expression ng mukha mo kahit hindi ka madalas ngumiti. Gusto ko yung mga sinasabi mo kapag ini-interview ka kahit puro kaartehan lang ang laman. Binabasa ko bawat word. Gusto talaga kita.

Alam ni Lei... kaya nagalit sya sa 'kin nung hindi ko inamin at idinamay ko pa si Eula. Alam kong dakilang sinungaling ang tingin nyo sa 'kin... pero ngayon nagsasabi na ako ng totoo.

Gusto talaga kita," mahaba nitong paliwanag.

 

Hindi agad nakapagsalita ang dalaga.

 

"Ano? Wala ka man lang sasabihin?" tanong nito sa kanya.

 

"Pwedeng antayin munang mag-process ng sinabi mo? It's kinda hard to take in."

"Ano bang mahirap intindihin sa sinabi ko? Hindi ba malinaw na gusto kita?" medyo iritado na ito.

Nagdabog ang dalaga. "Kase! Panggulo ka eh! Okay na lahat tapos saka ka sisingit!"

"Hindi ko naman sinabing sisingitan ko kayo di ba? Masamang umamin?"

"Hindi!"

"Bakit apektado ka masyado? May gusto ka sa 'kin noh?"

"Wala noh! Kapal nito..." nakanguso nyang sagot.

 

Tinawanan sya nito. Saka nito ginulo ang buhok nya. "Sabihin mo kay Zelo, pakabait sya sa 'yo. Baka agawin kita."

Pinalis niya ang kamay nito. "He'll never give me to you. 'Sides, sabi nya since childhood, gusto nya na ako. So technically, he knew me way before you did."

"Tss. Oo na. Kayo na."

She finally smiled at him. "No hard feelings?" Nagkibit-balikat lamang ito. "Akyat na tayo," aya nya rito. She took the bowl from the table. Inagaw naman nito yun mula sa kamay niya.

"Ako na," he insisted.

Muli nyang inagaw ang bowl mula sa kaibigan. "Wag ka nga! You'll make me feel awkward. I hate awkwardness."

"Arte mo. Pareho kayo ni Zelo."

"Thank you," she said with a smile, taking what he said as compliment.

 

--

 

"Oh ano? Kala mo naman 'sang katerba ang niluto nyong popcorn," reklamo ni Lei sa kanila.

"Nagrereklamo ka Analeigh? Hala 'wag bigyan."

"Joke lang. Nuod na kayo. Matatapos na."

"OA!" she exclaimed.

Nagtawanan sila. Naupo sya sa tabi ni Eula habang si Keeme naman ay naupo sa tabi ni Lei, sa kabilang side. Nagkatinginan sila tapos ay sabay na nagbawi ng tingin.

Spell awkward little heart?

 

--

Later that night, she called Zelo and asked him to go online.

"Oh?" patanong nitong bati sa kanya.

"May sasabihin ako," panimula niya.

"Ano? Sabihin mo na."

 

"Keeme said he likes me."

"Oh tapos?"

"Di ka man lang nagselos?" nakasimangot nyang tanong.

"Gusto mo ba sya?" pabalik na tanong nito sa kanya.

"Hindi."

"Yun naman pala eh."

She tsk-ed. "Ang KJ mo!"

Tumawa ito. "Yun lang ba? Bye na."

"Teka! Ano... uuwi ka ba?"

"Sabi mo umuwi ako, di ba?"

 

Napangiti sya sa sinabi nito. "Sige, I'll see you on Valentine's."

"Okay. Matulog ka na," utos nito sa kanya.

"Ayoko pa. Kwentuhan muna tayo."

"Ayoko. Saka na."

"Nakakainis ka! Ang KJ mo!"

"Bye." Bigla itong nawala sa monitor. Sa sobrang inis ng dalaga ay muntik na nyang maibato ang Mac book niya. Mabuti na lamang at napigilan nya ang sarili.

"Bye? Bye lang?! Wala man lang I love you! Kainis!" pagmamaktol niya.

Walang masyadong nabago sa relasyon nila ni Keeme. Nag-aasaran pa rin sila. Nagsasakitan. Yun nga lang ay may kaunti ng ilangan. She found it awkward to share things with him. Parang naninibago na rin sya kapag inaakbayan siya nito.

Then came February. February 13 umuwi si Zelo. Sinalubong ito ng mga kaibigan at ni Chastene na bago sa barkada sa airport.

Unang-unang yumakap ang dalaga dito. Nagkunwari namang nandidiri ang mga kaibigan nila.

 

Nagkumustahan sila sa SUV ng dalaga. Napakaingay nila. Ultimo si Chastene ay dumadaldal na rin. Si Eli ay medyo nawawala ang pagkailang. May pagka-alaskadora rin kase ni Chastene at madalas nitong pagtripan ay si Eli, na hindi naman makaganti dito.

"Wala kayong pasok bukas?" tanong ni Zelo sa mga kaibigan.

"Meron," si Eula ang sumagot. "Pagkatapos ng last class, punta na kami kina Dama."

"Uy pwedeng magsama bukas?" tanong naman ni Lei.

"Sure, basta 'wag ex mo," sagot ni Dama.

"Ako rin! Isasama ko si James... tapos sasabihin kong isama nya si Jairus!"

They all groaned. "Eula, tigilan."

"Bakit?" kunot-noo nitong tanong.

"Di mo ba naisip na baka nasasaktan na si James sa ginagawa mo?" tanong ni Keeme dito.

"At bakit naman sya masasaktan?"

 

Halos sabay-sabay silang napabuntong-hininga.

 

"Tanga ka rin eh," sabi niya sa kaibigan.

"Mana ka sa ate mo," sabat naman ni Zelo.

"Oy tigilan nyo kami ha!" saway ni Lei sa kanila.

 

Nakarating sila sa bahay nina Dama nang bandang alas-nwebe ng gabi. Nagkwentuhan sila ng mahigit isang oras pa bago nag-exit si Zelo para magpahinga. By 11pm, ipinahatid na ng dalaga ang mga kaibigan pauwi.

 

--

 

Kinabukasan ay punong-abala ang dalaga sa paghahanda para sa birthday ni Zelo. Kahit labag sa sinabi ng mga kabarkada ay binonggahan ng dalaga ang party. Todo effort sya sa paglalagay ng balloons na heart-shaped at sa pag-a-icing ng cakes. 

Yes, CAKES.

19 heart-shaped freaking cakes. Strawberry-flavored.

 

Nang dumating ang hapon ay inaya na niya si Zelo at ang iba pa sa sala. Nasa gilid lahat ng upuan at ang mga handa ay nasa area na napapagitnaan ng dalawang grand staircase ng bahay. Namula agad ang binata ng kantahan nila ito ng Happy Birthday. Nangingibabaw pa mandin ang boses ng dalaga na hindi masyadong kanais-nais sa tenga.

They all greeted him. Syempre kumain na rin sila. Sweet-sweetan ang magkasintahan kahit na nahihiya ang binata sa mga magulang niya. She insisted na talbugan nila ang sweetness ng parents nya.

Hindi naman cooperative si Zelo.

"Happy birthday pre," bati ni Keeme sa binata.

"Salamat," sagot nito.

 

Medyo disappointed ang dalaga. Ni wala man lang tension sa pagitan ng dalawa. Parang hindi nga yata talaga nagseselos si Zelo kay Keeme.

 

When it was time for gifts, nahihiya ring tinanggap ng binata ang regalo ng mga bisita. Pero syempre, hindi pumayag si Dama na matatalbugan ang regalo niya. Hinatak niya palabas ng mansion ang binata. Then she led him to the garage. 

Napanganga ang mga bisita sa nakita nila.

 

Isang Ducati... para kay Zelo.

 

"Did you like it?" nakangiti niyang tanong sa binata. Napansin ng dalagang napailing ang mga kaibigan niya pero dinedma lang niya ang mga ito. "Uy..." untag niya sa binata. "Talk."

Zelo sighed at saka sya hinila away from the crowd. Lakad lang ito nang lakad, dragging her along until they came up to the garden.

 

"Hindi mo ba nagustuhan?" nag-aalala nyang tanong.

Hinarap sya nito. "Hindi. Pati yung handaan, ayoko."

Napasimangot ang dalaga. "Why? Ano ba'ng mali sa ginawa ko?"

"Lahat."

"Di mo man lang papasalamatan ang effort ko? Sige ganyan ka!"

 

He rolled his eyes at her. "Di mo naman kase kailangang maghanda eh. Birthday ko lang yan. Taon-taon akong may ganyan."

"Eh importante kase yun para sa 'kin!" reklamo nya rito. 

"Yung motor... di ko tatanggapin."

 

Mangiyak-ngiyak na ang dalaga. "Sinayang ko yung shopping allowance ko para dun tapos hindi mo tatanggapin?!" sumbat niya dito.

"Wow! Salamat sa shopping allowance!" he said in sarcasm. "Ibalik mo, problema ba yun?"

Nagpahid ng luha ang dalaga. "Ang sama mo talaga! Ako todo effort tapos ayaw mo? Eh ikaw? Valentine's Day din ngayon baka nakakalimutan mo?"

 

"Sino ba'ng may sabing wala akong regalo sa 'yo?"

 

Napatunghay siya sa binata. "Meron? Asan?"

Iniabot nito sa kanya ang isang maliit na kahon na ngayon lang nya napansin na hawak nito. "Hindi yan kasing mahal ng Ducati mo pero pinaghirapan ko yan."

Dali-daling binuksan ng dalaga ang regalo ni Zelo.

 

Isang baboy na porcelain. May tatlong biik na nakapatong sa likuran ng inahin.

"Baboy?"

"Naaalala kase kita."

"Mukha akong baboy?!"

 

Tumawa ito. "Sira. Cute kase."

 

"Eh ako? Anong ireregalo ko sa 'yo? Ayaw mo naman nung Ducati."

 

He touched her chin and tilted her head slightly. Then he bent down and gave her a chaste kiss.

 

"Ikaw lang. Sapat na."

xxxxx

AN: Yak. Korni. Hahaha... pinapatulog na ko. Saglit lang ate pepay. Makabasa lang ako ng one or two comments after posting. XD Picture nung gift ni Zelo is nasa group. :> Sorry sa typos. Madalian.

Pagkatapos ng birthday party ng binata ay nagsibalikan na ang mga katulong sa pagtatrabaho. Una nilang ginawa ay ang mag-impis ng kalat. Hawak-hawak pa rin nya ang baboy na ibinigay ni Zelo sa kanya. 

Yes, he may not be as sweet as her dad... but she loves him just the same. Kakaiba kase itong magpakita ng pagmamahal... at minsanan lang. She feels special whenever he treats her special kase madalang lamang nito iyong gawin. 

"Halika," aya nito sa kanya. He held her hand and led her outside the mansion.

"San tayo pupunta?"

"Kay tatay," maikli nitong sagot.

 

Natuwa siya. He must really love her that much para ipakilala siya sa ama nito. She got excited and scared at the same time. Baka kase hindi siya magustuhan ng tatay nito dahil sa ugali nya. Naninigaw pa naman siya ng mga katulong dati.

Baka isa ito sa natarayan nya... di nya alam.

 

"Teka, asan ba ang tatay mo?" tanong niya sa binata. Nakita nya kaseng papalabas sila ng gate. 

"Basta," sagot nito.

"Malayo ba yan? Mag-kotse na kaya tayo?"

"Hindi. Sa likuran lang."

"Sa likod? Eh ang layo kaya nun!"

 

May mataas na mataas na bakod na nakapalibot sa lupain nila. At ilang ektarya rin ang lawak ng lugar kaya ang likuran na sinasabi ni Zelo ay hindi isang tumbling lang.

 

Binitawan nito ang kamay niya. "Kung ayaw mo, 'wag kang sumama. Dami mong arte." Nagpatuloy ito sa paglalakad. 

Agad naman siyang sumunod dito at saka niya ito kinapitan sa braso. "Eto na nga, maglalakad na."

 

--

 

Mag-iisang oras silang naglakad nang sa wakas ay makarating na rin sila sa pupuntahan. Mapuno sa likuran ng property nila. Hindi pa kase ito gaanong developed. Nakita niya ang isang malaking puno na may kulay white na lubid na nakaikot sa katawan nito.

Then she saw on it's ground... isang lapida.

Tiningnan niya ang binata. She couldn't read his expression. Hindi naman ito mukhang malungkot... pero hindi rin masaya.

"Ayan ang tatay ko," sabi nito ng nakaturo sa lapida.

"Zelo..."

Pilit itong ngumiti. "Alam mo ba... dahil sa 'kin, nagawa nyang magnakaw? Sakitin akong bata. Halos araw-araw, may sakit ako. Mahirap lang kami at walang pambili ng gamot si itay. Puro utang na kami sa tindahan na malapit sa 'min. Minsan... palapit pa lang si tatay para mangutang, minumura na sya ng tindera.

Madalas ring magkasakit si Itay dahil hindi sya kumakain. Naging basurero sya dati. Tapos kada umaga, isang pandesal lang yung kinakain nya. Sa akin yung dalawa... tapos yung kape, sa akin na lang din. Sa tanghali, ipangbibili nya ng gamot at pagkain yung kaunting pera na naitatabi nya mula sa pagbabasura. Tapos iinom sya ng tubig at bibili ng tinapay... saka sya aalis ulit para naman magtrabaho bilang barker sa mga istasyon ng jeep na malapit sa 'min.

Sa gabi... itinutulog na lang nya ang gutom. Hindi ko nga alam kung pano nya nakayanan na ganoon sya araw-araw... lalo na kapag walang nagpapautang sa 'min ng pambili ng pagkain..."

 

Hindi sya makapagkumento. Hindi nya kase alam kung ano'ng tamang sabihin para mapagaan ang loob nito. He doesn't look like he's on the verge of crying. In fact, mukhang okay naman ito. Pero ang lungkot lang kase ng kinikwento nito sa kanya. Natatakot syang baka kinikimkim lang nito ang sakit.

Unable to say anything, hinawakan na lamang niya ang kamay nito and gave it a little squeeze.

 

"Alam mo bang savior ko ang mama mo?"

Tumango siya. "Yes. Diba kinupkop kayo ni mama?"

"Mabait ang mama mo... kahit magaspang ang ugali. Siguro isa na rin yun sa dahilan kung bakit nagustuhan kita. Para ka kaseng ang mama mo. Sa una lang masama."

 

"Zelo nalulungkot ka ba?" nag-aalala niyang tanong dito.

"Oo naman. Ikaw ba naman ang ulila ng lubos?"

"Asan ang mama mo?" tanong niya.

"Wala. Ewan. Matagal na yatang patay. Bata pa lang ako nung iwan nya kami ni tatay. Nakakita kase sya ng mas mayaman eh. Hindi ko rin naman siguro sya masisisi. Mahirap lang kase si tatay." Parang may kung ano sa sinabi nito na nagpa-inis sa kanya.

Maybe because she's rich and he's not? Nandun kase yung feeling. Yung feeling na parang iniisip nito na may posibilidad na gawin niya rin iyon dito dahil baka magsawa siya sa buhay mahirap.

 

"Wag ka nang masyadong malungkot. Nandito naman ako. Nandito kami... pamilya mo na rin kami, di ba?"

Bumitaw ito sa kamay niya at inakbayan siya.

"Alam mo bang matagal ko ng sinabi kay tatay na gusto kita? Bata pa ata ako."

"Eh?!" She immediately blushed.

"Pinagtawanan nya nga lang ako eh. Pero nung inulit ko nung bago ako mag-college, sabi nya sa 'kin tigilan ko na daw ang pangangarap. Sabi nya di daw tayo bagay."

"Bagay kaya tayo! Sabi nila parehas daw tayong maarte."

 

Natawa ito sa sinabi niya. "Umuwi na nga tayo."

 

--

 

"Mahal mo ba ang tatay mo?" tanong niya ng makarating sila sa mansion.

"Oo naman. Mahal na mahal," sagot nito.

"Eh ang nanay mo?"

"Hindi ko alam. Kung si Nanay Pacing... oo mahal ko yun."

 

--

 

Gabi na pero hindi pa rin umuuwi ang mga kaibigan ng dalaga. Overnight kase ang mga ito sa kanila. Mag-iinom daw. Aba eh ngayon lang sila ulit nakumpleto... may bonus pa!

Nasa terrace ang magbabarkada. Nakalatag doon ang isang carpet at napapaligiran ito ng throw pillows. Nakaikot sila sa mga pulutan at inumin.

And the best part? Nakaupo sa likuran niya si Zelo at nakayakap ito sa kanya. Sukang-suka ang magbabarkada sa pwesto nila pero siya naman ay tuwang-tuwa.

 

"Tagay." Iniabot ni Keeme ang tagayan sa kanya. She reached out for it pero inunahan siya ni Zelo. Ito ang kumuha at tumungga ng tagay na para sa kanya.

She looked at him pero parang wala lang naman. Pero parang may kakaiba din. Hindi nya lang malaman kung ano.

Ibinalik nito ang tagayan kay Keeme at nang makita syang nakatingin dito ay ngumiti ito. Saka sya hinalikan sa pisngi.

"Luh! Pangatlong tagay pa lang Zelo... lasing ka na?" gulat na tanong ni Eula.

"Kadiri kayo! Umayos nga kayo!" saway naman sa kanila ni Lei.

 

Hindi naman sya makapagsalita. Para talagang may iba eh. May masama na naman bang mangyayari at ubod na naman ng keso ng boyfriend nya? O hindi lang talaga siya sanay na ganoon ito?

 

"Oh Eli." Iniabot ni Keeme ang tagay kay Eli. Seryoso ito... napansin nya. There's this feeling of guilt inside her na hindi niya malaman kung paano aalisin. Para kaseng responsable sya sa feelings ng kaibigan niya.

Pero ano nga naman ang magagawa nya? She can't reciprocate the love he can give because she can't give him that. Sana kase ay hindi na lamang ito nagtapat sa kanya.

 

Naramdaman nyang humigpit ang yakap ni Zelo sa kanya. Itinuon pa nito ang baba nito sa balikat nya.

"Happy Valentine's mahal," bulong nito sa kanya.

She shivered all over at that one word. Makailang beses na ba nyang hiniling na sana man lang ay magka-endearment ito sa kanya?

 

Little heart... 'wag ka ngang hyper! saway niya sa puso na kanina pa kumakabog.

 

"Ang korni nung dalawa, naiinis ako!" pagmamaktol ni Eula.

Kinuha naman ni Keeme ang cellphone mula sa bulsa nito. "Picturan natin. Para may remembrance kayo kapag naghiwalay na kayo," biro nito. 

She stuck her tongue out at him.

"Ulul. Sino'ng may sabing maghihiwalay kami?" tanong ni Zelo. Mukhang seryoso ito kaya wala ng nag-follow up question.

"Eh di kayo na," sabi na lamang ni Keeme.

 

--

 

Halos mag-aalas dos na ng madaling araw ng matapos silang mag-inuman. Kanina pa nakapikit at nakasandal si Dama kay Zelo para hindi sya matagayan. Hilong-hilo na kase sya.

Naramdaman nyang binuhat siya ng binata at inihiga sa kama.

 

--

 

Kinabukasan... Nagising ang dalaga sa pagtatawanan ng mga barkada. Nagmulat siya ng mata at bumangon. 

"Morning," bati ni Zelo sa kanya. Nakasandal ito sa headboard at nakaakbay sa kanya. Mukhang magkatabi na naman silang natulog. Nasa kabila naman niya si Eula na tawa rin ng tawa.

Si Eli kase... puro sulat ang mukha. Galit na ito at parang iiyak.

 

"Wala kaming kasalanan dyan! Sisihin mo si Chastene!" natatawang sabi ni Lei.

"Umamin na kayo! Sino pa bang wawalang-hiya sa mukha ko kundi kayo lang?" pikon nitong tanong.

"Ah? Ayaw maniwala! Si Chastene nga kase ang may gawa nyan!" pagpupumilit naman ni Keeme.

"Ah ewan!" Ginulo nito ang buhok at padabog na nag-iikot sa kwarto niya. Sakto namang pumasok si Chastene na may dalang isang tray ng kape.

Pagkakita nito kay Eli ay napangisi ito.

 

"Kitams! Nakangiti ang guilty oh!" Eula pointed out.

"Umamin ka na nga Chas," Lei said to her.

 

Nagkatingin sina Chastene at Eli. Bakas sa mukha ni Eli ang pagkabahala. Paano nga naman kase kung yung crush nya mismo ang nagwalang-hiya sa mukha nya? Makakapalag ba sya? Pentel pen pa naman ang gamit.

 

"Ako nga. Tinatanggi ko ba?" nakangiting tanong ng dalaga.

 

xxxxx

AN: Tip: Wag kang magpapakalasing sa inuman kapag barkada ang kasama mo. Trust me, naranasan ko na yan. Mga walangya kase yung mga tropa ko. Ginagawa akong freedon wall. LOL.

--







Tiningnan ni Eli ang sarili sa salamin. Nagmumukha syang panda dahil sa dalawang bilog na naka-drawing sa mga mata niya. Meron din syang mustache at balbas. Tapos yung patilya na parang kay Elvis Presley.

Gusto nyang mainis. Makailang beses na silang nag-inom ng barkada pero ni minsan ay hindi sya naganito.

Tapos si Chastene na ke bago-bago sa barkada ay nagaganito sya? Porket crush nya ito. Hindi nga niya alam kung halata ba nitong may gusto sya rito.

 

"Eli?"

 

He saw her through the mirror. Nakatayo ito sa may pintuan, nagpipigil ng tawa sa itsura nya. Napanguso siya. "Ano?" tanong niya rito ng may halong pagtatampo.

Ngumiti ito sa kanya at saka lumapit.

"Sorry. Ang mantika mo kaseng matulog kagabi," she said. Kumuha ito ng wet tissue na nakapatong sa may lababo.

She held his chin so that he won't move at saka nito pinahid ng basang tissue ang mukha niya.

Being this close to her, he got a chance to see her face up close. Maganda si Chastene. She has this pleasant face na kahit badtrip ka, kapag nakita mo ay mapapangiti ka talaga.

 

For a second ay nagkatinginan sila. He quickly looked at something else. Eh napatungo sya. Ayun... his gaze landed on her breasts.

"Eli!" saway nito sabay sampal sa kanya.

"Sorry naman nataranta lang!" Napahawak siya sa pisngi niya. "Aray ko naman..."

Tumawa ito. "Sorry. Reflexes."

 

He fell silent again as she continues to clean his face.

 

--

 

Nang makapaligo na silang lahat ay nagpunta na sila sa kusina para kumain ng late breakfast. Dama's parents and Dylan already ate. So sila lamang magkakaibigan ang magkakasabay kumain.

Ginisang sugpo ang ulam. Nakalagay ito sa dalawang malalaking cooking pots. Halos wala ng kaning mailagay sa pinggan ang magkakaibigan dahil puro sugpo ang laman ng plato nila.

 

She was busily de-shelling her prawns nang agawin ni Zelo ang plato niya. Then he gave her his na puro balat na ang sugpo na nakalagay.

"Thank you!" she said with a smile. Nilagyan niya ng kanin ang pinggan at saka sya nagsimulang kumain habang ang mga kaibigan ay nakatingin lamang sa kanya na naiinggit.

"Zelo ako rin!" reklamo ni Eula.

Inilapit naman nina Chastene at Lei ang mga plato nila na may lamang hipon na may shells pa.

 

Zelo looked blandly at them. "Wala kayong kamay?"

Sumimangot ang mga ito. "Eh bakit si Dama?"

 

Sumabat ang dalaga, "Girlfriend kayo?" taas-kilay nyang tanong.

"Oo na best. Ikaw na!"

She laughed. "Ako na nga. Kumain na lang kayo..." Binalingan naman niya si Zelo. "Hoy kumain ka na rin," sabi nya rito. Nagbabalat pa kase ito ng sugpo nito.

"Kumain ka na lang. Wag mo 'kong intindihin," sagot nito.

Kumuha sya ng sugpo at iniumang sa bibig nito.

"Eat," she commanded.

Tumingin ito sa kanya. "Kulit mo."

"Dali na... nangangalay ako," she pointed out. Tiningnan muna siya nito ng masama bago nito isinubo ang sugpo na hawak niya.

 

"Kadiri kayo," Eula muttered.

"Inggit ka lang," sagot naman niya.

"Oh..." It was Zelo's turn this time. Sinusubuan sya ng pagkain. Nakangiti naman niyang tinanggap iyon.

"Yuck! Makalipat nga. Nasusuka ako," deklara ni Lei. Tumayo ito at dinala ang plato. "Hoy Keeme, dun tayo sa balcony dali!" untag niya sa kaibigan nilang kanina pa tahimik.

Walang anu-ano'y tumayo na rin ito at lumabas ng kusina kasama ni Lei.

 

--

 

Naupo sina Lei at Keeme sa sahig ng balkunahe. Tiled naman iyon at palaging malinis. Inilapag nila ang mga plato sa sahig saka sila sumandal sa pader at pumwesto ng naka-Indian sit.

"Musta pre?" panimulang tanong ni Lei.

"Sarap ng sugpo," sagot nito sabay kagat sa sugpo na hawak.

"Gago. Sagutin mo yung tanong ko."

"Mas gago ka. Nagtatanong ka ng obvious. Hashtag-"

 

Hindi na nito naituloy ang sasabihin dahil binatukan nya na ito.

"Punyeta naman! Marumi yang kamay mo!" singhal nito sa kanya.

Imbes na tumigil ay inihilamos pa niya ang kamay sa mukha ng kaibigan.

"Arrrgh!" tumayo ito at nagdabog. Tapos ay hinubad ang t-shirt na suot para linisin ang mukha at batok.

"Gago ka talaga!" naiinis nitong sabi sa kanya.

Tinawanan naman niya ito.

 

Keeme resigned on the spot next to her. Napabuntong-hininga na lamang ito habang nakatitig sa malawak na lupain na nasa harapan nila.

"Nasasaktan ka dude?" tanong niya.

"Hashtag keri lang," sagot nito.

"Shunga mo noh? Di mapakali sa hashtag?" 

Keeme chuckled. "Ganun talaga."

"Seryoso... nasasaktan ka nga?"

He rolled his eyes at her. "Kung ikaw, makita mo si Jeric na may kasamang iba, di ka masasaktan?" tanong nito sa kanya.

"Syempre masasaktan," sagot naman niya.

"Oh... ganun din ako."

 

They fell silent for a while. Kumuha siya ng isang sugpo, binalatan iyon at kinain.

"So wala kang balak makipag-agawan?" curious niyang tanong.

Nagkibit-balikat ito. 

"Ano yan? Sumagot ka ng maayos!" she demanded.

 

"Wala," he said flatly.

 

"Wala? Seryoso ka?"

"Ano namang mahihita ko? Gusto nila isa't isa. Parang tanga naman kung sisingit pa 'ko, di ba?"

"Hmmm... sabagay nga." She patted his shoulder. "Ayos lang yan pre. Part ng life..."

Pinalis naman nito ang kamay niya.

 

"Ang dumi sabi ng kamay mo!"

 

--

 

Saturday. Nasa mansion pa rin ang magbabarkada. Wala silang ginawa maghapon kundi maglaro ng Wii, PS2, Xbox... Nang manakit ang mga mata ay lumabas naman sila at gumala sa lupain nina Dama. They were even taught to ride horses.

Nag-swimming na rin sila. Nag-Frisbee. Nakipaghabulan sa mga aso. At kumain ng kumain ng kumain. When night came, lahat sila ay pagod na pagod na.

Kaya nanuod na lang sila ng movie... habang nag-iinom.

 

Tumayo si Keeme mula sa pwesto nito at lumipat sa terrace. Tinatamad daw kase itong manuod.

 

Sa kalagitnaan ng movie ay nagpunta rin sa terrace ang dalaga para magpahangin. Hindi naman kase kagaya ng dati na 24 hours na naka-aircon ang kwarto niya kapag nasa bahay lamang siya.

 

Holding a beer at hand, the two of them stood a meter apart from each other. Parehong nakatitig sa kawalan. They were like that for the whole 20 minutes until she felt like it was getting colder.

Papasok na sana ulit siya sa kwarto ng maramdaman niyang may yumakap sa kanya mula sa likuran.

She immediately blushed when she felt Zelo's arms wrapped around her... his face on her shoulder. Kumakabog ka na naman little heart, turan niya sa puso na biglang nag-accelerate ang pagpintig.

"Z-Zelo..."

"Nilalamig ka. Halata," he whispered.

 

"Oo na. Kayo na."

 

Parehas silang napatingin kay Keeme na nakatingin sa kanila pareho. Hawak nito ang isang bote ng beer sa isang kamay. Ang isa naman ay nakapamay-awang. Nakapatong ang siko nito sa railings.

"Inggit ka pare?" tanong ni Zelo dito.

"Gago," sagot ni Keeme.

 

Hindi malaman ng dalaga kung magka-away ba o ano ang dalawa. Kalmado naman sila pareho. Mga nakangiti pa nga.

"Pakayap din!" biro nito kay Zelo.

Agad naman siyang inilayo ng binata. "Yakapin mo sarili mo," sabi nito kay Keeme.

 

"Ano ba kayo! 'Wag nyo nga akong pag-agawan!" saway nya sa mga ito.

 

Nilingon sya ni Zelo at tinapik ng malakas sa noo. "Wag ka ngang feeling dyan."

"Oo nga. Hashtag feeler Dama?" nakangiting tanong ni Keeme sa kanya.

Sinimangutan nya ang dalawa. "Ang labo nyo, alam nyo yun?"

 

Tumawa ang dalawang lalaki. Somehow, it put her at ease. Nakakaloka man ang relationships nilang magbabarkada, at least naman, one has sense enough to back off when he knows he doesn't stand a chance.

Sana nga lang ay makahanap na si Keeme ng ipapalit sa kanya. She likes Keeme... but not to an extent na kaya nyang ipagpalit si Zelo.

Para nya na kase itong kuya. Alaskador pero maalaga...

 

--

 

"Ma, aren't you cold?"

Ibinalabal ni Dani ang cashmere sweater na hawak sa asawa.

"Five minutes pa lang naman ako sa labas dad," sagot nito sa kanya.

 

Nakatayo si Meg sa terrace ng kwarto nila, nagpapahangin. Niyakap niya ang asawa at hinalikan sa pisngi.

"What are you thinking?" he asked. Naging habit na nya ang tanungin ang asawa ng ganun. Madalas kase ay hindi nya ito maintindihan. And he would sometimes be confused by her actions, lalo na kapag bigla itong nagagalit sa kanya.

By him asking her what's on her mind, nagiging aware siya sa bawat saloobin ng asawa at any time of the day.

"I'm thinking about Dyma. Di sya naghapunan eh. Do you think he's okay?"

"Don't worry about him ma. He'll eat when he's hungry."

"Eh dad... kanina pa sya nagkukulong. Ano kayang ginagawa nya?" nag-aalalang tanong nito sa kanya.

 

"Hmm... maybe guy stuffs?"

 

Isang malakas na hampas sa braso ang naisagot sa kanya ng asawa. He laughed.

"No way!" reklamo nito.

"Ma... he's fourteen. It's normal," he assured her.

"No! Stop it dad! Ugh..." Napasapo si Meg. "I don't want him to think of those things yet. Bata pa ang baby ko."

"I'm just kidding ma. Sorry," he said then kissed her again. "I'll go check out if he's okay," paalam niya rito.

"Okay... sabihin mo kumain na sya ha?"

"I will."

 

--

 

Dani through the slightly opened door of Dyma's room. Bukas lahat ng ilaw pero wala sa kama ang anak niya. Nakaupo ito opposite the mirror wall with a chess board on his front. Nakapangalumbaba ito.

"Son?"

Tumunghay ito sa kanya. "Yes dad?"

"Hindi ka ba nagugutom? Your mom wants you to eat dinner first. It's past eight already," he said to him.

"I'll just finish this game," sagot nito sa kanya.

 

Nilapitan niya ang anak at tinabihan. Kunot na kunot ang noo nito habang nagku-concentrate sa paglalaro ng chess.

"Dad? Why can't I beat myself? No matter how hard I try, natatalo pa rin ako," turan nito.

Natawa sya sa sinabi ng anak. Dyma is reserved and quiet. Nakakausap lang ito ng matino kapag may chess na involved. Kaya naman sobrang na-depress ito ng mamatay ang lolo nito.

Ito lang kase yung madalas kumausap sa kanya.

 

He admits that he's not trying his hardest to reach out to his son. Busy kase sa trabaho and his focus is on his wife na ilang buwan na lamang ay manganganak na.

"Can we play?" he asked.

"Really dad?" gulat nitong tanong. He saw in his eyes the excitement. Isang simpleng tanong lang pero mukhang massayang-masaya na ito.

"Yes. Really."

 

Iniharap ni Dyma ang board sa kanya at saka nito inayos ang chess pieces.

"Dad, I'll tell you a secret if you beat me."

He was taken aback with his son's change of aura. Naging competitive ito bigla.

"Really? Okay," pagsang-ayon na lamang niya.

 

Una niyang move ay ang horse na nasa kanan. Dyma countered with the bishop. He drew a pawn. Dyma retaliated. Hanggang sa...

"Checkmate."

 

"What? Wait! How-"

"This dad..." Itinumba ni Dyma ang horse niya. It was eaten by Dyma's horse and trapped the king.

"How did you even do that?!"

 

Ngumiti ang anak niya sa kanya. "I know a lot of variations of the four moves," sagot nito.

"Teach me! Maglalaro kami ng mommy mo minsan."

"Mom won't play with you. She hates chess," Dyma pointed out.

"All the more na makipaglaro dapat ako sa kanya so I could beat her."

Tumawa ito. "Mom won't like that."

 

"How good is your ate?"

Napaisip ito sa tanong nya. "Hmmm... let's just say that you won't last five minutes with her dad," sagot nito.

"You're exaggerating..."

 

"No. I swear she can beat you with her eyes closed."

 

Sinimangutan niya ang anak. "Sige na. Kayo na ang magaling sa chess." Ginulo nya ang buhok nito. Saka sya tumayo. "Eat first before going to bed, okay?"

"Yes dad," sagot nito.

 

Nasa may pintuan na siya ng lingunin nya itong muli. "Son... about that secret. Ano yun?"

"Kaya nga secret dad eh..."

"Clue?" tanong niya.

 

Ngiti lang ang isinagot nito. Nagkibit-balikat na lamang siya saka lumabas ng kwarto.

"Dad, what's he doing?" alalang tanong ni Meg nang makabalik siya sa master's bedroom.

"Playing with himself," sagot niya.

Napasinghap si Meg. "Oh God..."

 

Realizing that she thought of something else, napatawa siya. "No. I meant he's playing chess with himself."

Nakita niya ang relief sa mukha ng asawa.

"Akala ko naman..."

 

Niyakap niya ito at hinalikan sa noo.

"Ma... may nalaman ako tungkol kay Dyma."

 

"What?"

 

 

 

"He already has a girlfriend. But it's a secret. Don't tell him I told you."

AN: Sabaw ang utak ko. Sarreh. Demand more... maloka kayo kakahintay. Hahaha...

"Zelo, can I ask you something?" she asked him. Nakahiga silang dalawa sa hammock na nakatali sa dalawang naglalakihang puno. Nakasandal siya sa balikat nito habang ito naman ay natatakpan ng kaliwang braso ang mga mata.

"Hmm?"

"Can you not go back to North Carolina tomorrow?"

Tinanggal nito ang tabing sa mga mata at saka tumingin sa kanya.

"Hindi pwede," sagot nito.

She pouted. "Eeeee... why?"

"May klase ako."

"Eh bakit hindi ka na lang dito mag-aral?"

"Gusto ko sa ibang bansa."

"Eh di dun na rin lang ako," she suggested.

"Ayoko."

 

Lalo syang napasimangot. "Bakit naman?"

"Kaya nga ako nangibang-bansa para malayo sa 'yo eh," sagot nito.

She slapped his arm. "Salbahe ka!"

Tumawa ito.

 

"Pero seryoso nga... dahil ba sa 'kin kaya dun ka nag-aral?" nakasimangot niyang tanong.

"Tingin mo?" pabalik nitong tanong.

"Sagutin mo na lang kase..." she demanded.

 

Napabuntong-hininga ang binata at sa mga dahon na nasa itaas ng puno nito itinuon ang tingin. He then placed his right arm under her nape.

"Mangako ka muna..."

"Na?"

"Na wala kang gagawin," sagot nito.

"Gagawin about what?"

"Basta. Mangako ka muna."

"Okay. Pinkie promise?" She raised her right pinkie finger. He did the same with his left. Saka nila iyon pinag-intertwine. "Ano ba kase yun?" she asked after.

 

"Nandun kase ang nanay ko."

 

Nanlaki ang mata niya sa gulat. She never thought na importante dito ang nanay nito. He doesn't like talking about his mother. For him, she's just a part of his bad past. Pero ngayon ay nag-aral pa ito sa Carolina para mapalapit sa nanay nito.

She wanted to meet his mother. Gusto nyang malaman kung paano nito nagawang iwan ang anak. She's pretty sure Zelo was a good kid. Full of animosity, yeah... pero dala na rin siguro iyon ng pag-abanduna dito ng ina.

"You knew?"

Tumango ito. "Huling habilin yun ng tatay ko. Gusto nyang makilala ko ang nanay ko. Ayoko man..." his voice trailed off. Nakatingin pa rin ito sa mga dahon sa itaas nila.

"So kaya ka lang nag-aral dun kase malapit ka sa nanay mo?" she asked.

"Oo," was his clipped answer.

"Huh..." Bahagya syang bumangon at saka sya yumuko dito. "Don't you want to see her?"

Umiling ito.

"Bakit?"

"Hindi ko naman mahal ang nanay ko eh."

 

Nalungkot ang dalaga sa sinabi nito. "That's not a good thing to say Zelo. Kami ni mommy, kahit halos magpatayan kami dati, I still love her. I mean, I am nothing without her. I owe her my existence..."

"Kahit naman nag-aaway kayo, alam mong may pakialam sya sa 'yo. Hindi katulad ng nanay ko," he replied.

"What will you do once you see her?"

"Ewan."

"What if she wants to have you back?" tanong niyang muli sa binata.

"Ewan ko," sagot nito.

 

Niyakap niya ang binata sa bewang nito. "I hope you find it in your heart to forgive her. She's your mother after all."

"Ang tanong... hihingi ba sya ng tawad?"

 

--

 

Ilang araw na mula ng makaalis ang binata. Everything went back to normal. Normal as in boring. Normal as in she's back to having no love life. Normal as in she's missing him again. Naaalala pa nya yung nakakatawang convo nila sa airport last Sunday.

"Wag ka na kase umalis!" ungot nya sa kasintahan habang nakayakap dito.

"Hindi nga pwedeng hindi. Kulit mo!" Pinitik siya nito ng mahina sa noo.

 

Hinatak naman siya ng kaibigang si Eula palayo kay Zelo. "Best... tigilan ang kaartehan. Magkikita pa kayo."

"Oo nga. Kung makakapit 'to kala mo katapusan na ng mundo!" sabat naman ni Lei.

"Clingy masyado. Makipag-break ka na nga Zelo," Keeme suggested.

Agad naman siyang niyakap ni Zelo, as if protecting her from being taken away by something OR someone. "Mukha mo Astel," he replied to Keeme.

Tumawa naman si Keeme. "Ano? Gwapo?"

Binatukan ito ni Lei. "Bawas-bawasan mo nga yang pagka-assumero mo!"

"Aray ko naman! Masamang mag-joke?" naiirita nitong tanong.

 

They all laughed.

 

"Kung magjo-joke ka, yung nakakatawa naman!" sabat ni Eli.

"Oo nga. Gayahin mo si Eli, wala pang ginagawa, nakakatawa na," Chastene added.

They all looked at Chastene, amused. "Ah! Hinahard ka pre! Gantihan mo!" untag ni Keeme kay Eli. Napasimangot naman itong isa at biglang nanahimik.

"Wala. Tiklop ka pala eh," naiiling na sabi ni Eula.

"Oh mabalik tayo sa dalawang bida."

 

Tumingin ang barkada sa kanilang dalawa.

"Alis na 'ko," paalam ng binata sa kanya.

"When will you come back?" she asked.

"September," maikli nitong sagot.

She stomped her foot. "Ang tagal pa!"

Tumawa ang binata. "Ganun talaga. Para mamiss mo."

"Eeee... uwi ka sa March!" she demanded.

"Ayoko. Ang mahal mahal ng pamasahe eh."

"Eh di ba mahal mo naman ako?" paglalambing niya rito.

"Oo nga. Kaso mas mahal yung pamasahe," sagot nito.

 

"Hala basag."

"Sa 'kin ka na lang kase."

"Hala bumabanat si Astel oh!"

 

Tiningnan ni Zelo ng masama si Keeme saka nito binalingan si Eli. "Eli, 'wag mong papalapitin si Astel dito ha," sabi nito sa kaibigan sabay turo sa kanya. "Kailangan laging 3 meters ang layo nila sa isa't isa."

Nagmukhang problemado si Eli. "Hala... susukatin ko pa?"

Napa-face palm si Lei. "Oo na lang Eli," she said in resignation.

 

His flight was then called. Tinanggal nito ang kamay niya mula sa pagkakayakap dito. "Kita na lang tayo sa September," sabi nito sa kanya.

Napasimangot ang dalaga.

"Wag kang sumimangot. Napangit ka lalo."

Hinampas niya ito sa braso. "Mang-iiwan ka na nga, manlalait ka pa!"

 

Tumawa ito at hinalikan sya sa pisngi. "Sige na. Bye."

 

Kinuha nito ang hand carry na nasa sahig at binitbit habang naglalakad palayo sa kanila.

"Zelo!" she called. Lumingon ito. "Mag-po-propose ka sa 'kin ah!"

"Oo! Pagbalik ko!" mabilis nitong sagot.

 

Saka sila pareho natigilan. Nagkatinginan silang dalawa while the gang suddenly cracked up.

 

"Ang epic!"

"Ayeee... si best kinikilig!"

"Pasintabi po kay Keeme."

 

She smiled at Zelo. "Sabi mo yan ah! Wala nang bawian!"

Zelo rolled his eyes at her. "Oo na lang."

Yung pangako na yun... no matter how informal, ang pinanghahawakan nya. That someday, he will ask her to marry him. Funny.... just last year, she would never think of marrying a guy who is way below her stratosphere. She would never imagine herself happy with the company of people she barely knew.

She would never say I love you to her mom.

She would never like her younger brother.

 

In a way, masaya syang napalayas sya ng bahay. Truly, mothers know best. Well... a lot of them at least. Some may have not agreed that her mom's way is right. In many ways, yes, it is wrong and kind of heartless... but nevertheless, it did them good.

Nakahanap sya ng mga kaibigan.

Nakaramdam sya ng pagmamahal.

Napalapit siya sa pamilya niya.

 

All is good. All is good little heart, she said to herself. Maya-maya'y isang malakas na sigaw ang narinig niyang umalingawngaw sa buong bahay.

"Yaya!" She panicked. Manganganak na yata ang mommy nya.

"Ate, what's happening?" litong-tanong ng kapatid niya.

"I think mom's about to give birth!" taranta niyang sagot. "Quick! Call dad!"

Nasa trabaho pa noon ang daddy nila. It was only passed seven in the evening. Nakaupo silang magkapatis sa sala. He was watching TV while she was staring into space... nang maghihiyaw ang mommy nila.

 

Dyma was already calling their dad while she ran upstairs to help her mom. Isang katulong ang kumuha ng wheelchair. Since hindi sila makakababa sa staircase ay ginamit nila ang elevator ng bahay.

When they were down on the first floor ay pilit nyang pinapakalma ang ina kahit sya mismo ay halos mawindang na dahil mukhang hirap na hirap ito.

"M-Mom... calm down, okay? Dad's on his way..."

"I-I'm fine sweetie," her mom said while panting.

 

"Ate! The car's ready!"

 

Tinanguan niya ang kapatid at sabay nilang inihatid ang ina sa sasakyan. Ipinatawag rin niya ang isa pa nilang driver at ipinasundo dito ang mga kaibigan niya.

Kailangan nya ng karamay. She feels like fainting.

 

--

 

Nang makarating sa ospital ay agad na ipinasok sa ER ang mommy nila.

"Stay with me sweetie," her mom said to her. Sobrang kapit ito sa kamay niya at ayaw siyang pakawalan.

She asked the nurse, "Can I-"

Nakangiti itong tumango. Pumasok siya sa ER kasama ang ina. Pinagbihis siya ng mga ito. They gave her a pair of gloves and mask saka pinahawakan ang kamay ng mommy nya.

 

--

 

"Push mom! Push! You can do it!" she said, trying to be encouraging.

 

--

 

"Konting push na lang Mrs. Dirham..."

 

--

 

After what seemed like indefinite minutes later...

"Congratulations ma'am... it's a girl."

Halos mangiyak-ngiyak ang dalaga ng ipahawak sa kanya ang kapatid na bagong silang.

"Mom... I might-"

"It's okay sweetie. I trust you..."

 

Nanginginig man ang mga kamay ay dahan-dahan niyang kinuha ang sanggol na iniaabot sa kanya. Tuluyan ng pumatak ang luha niya ng makita ang nakapikit na sanggol.

"She's so tiny!" she exclaimed.

Mahinang tumawa ang mommy nya. "Does she look like me?" tanong nito sa kanya.

"No. She looks like me," biro niya sa ina. Inilagay niya ang kapatid sa braso ng ina. "Can I call dad?" she asked the nurse.

Tumango ito.

Dali-dali naman siyang lumabas ng ER.

 

--

 

She saw her dad walking back and forth, his face etched with worry. Nakatitig lang ito sa sahig habang ang isang kamay ay nasa bewang nito. Ang isa ay nakatakip sa bibig.

"Best!" tawag sa kanya ng kaibigan. It drew her dad's attention to her. He took three large steps towards her.

"How's your mom? How's the baby? Are they both okay? Is it a boy? Girl? Can I go inside-"

She held up her hands. "DAD... calm down."

 

Pinahinga nya ng malalim ang ama. Sumunod naman ito. He breathed in and out a few times before he finally calmed down.

"Are you okay now?" she asked.

Tumango ito. "Yeah. Thanks."

She smiled at her dad. Pumasok naman ito sa loob ng ER.

"Can I go as well?" tanong ni Dyma sa kanya.

"Later na lang. Hayaan muna natin silang magsolo."

 

--

 

A few days later...

"Uy best! Bakit ang laki ng mata ng kapatid nyo? Kanino mana?" tanong sa kanya ni Eula.

Nakaikot sila sa kama kung saan nakahiga sa gitna ang kapatid niyang bunso. Nakatingin lang ito kay Dyma. Her sister have large, doey eyes... unlike theirs na singkitin.

Nasa tigkabilang-gilid silang magbabarkada, pinapanuod ang bawat galaw ng kapatid niya. Kanina pa nga ito nakatingin kay Dyma.

"Siguro sa kabit ni mommy," she said nonchalantly.

"Ate!"

"Joke lang! Di pwedeng mag-joke?!"

 

"Ssssshhhh!" saway nina Eli at Chastene.

 

"Sorry." She clamped her mouth and stared at her sister. Nakipagtitigan naman ito sa kanya.

"Mukhang may katapat ka na ah..." puna ni Lei.

"Di yan," she assured them.

"Ano nga daw palang ipapangalan nyo kay baby girl?" tanong ni Eula sa kanya.

"Dhar Maiel," sagot niya.

 

"Dhar Ma-ano?" kunot-noong tanong ni Eli.

"Basta! Basta Dharma ang nickname..."

"Weird naman."

"Ganun talaga..."

"Weird kase ang nagbigay."

"Ha. Ha. Ha. Tawa well."

 

"Uy quiet! Nakakatulog na si baby!" Keeme hushed.

"Grabe... inantok pa yan sa ingay natin?" natatawang tanong ni Eula.

"Alam mo naman, mana yata sa ate nyang abnormal," sabat naman ni Eli.

"So hinahard nyo 'ko?" taas-kilay nyang tanong.

"Hindi naman best. Slight lang. Anyway, matanong ko lang... bakit nasa work ang daddy mo nung manganak ang mommy mo? Di ba dapat naka-leave sya?"

 

She sighed. "May emergency meeting kase. Ayaw nila ng confe. Ayun, napilitang pumunta ni dad sa office for a few hours. Eh malay ba naman naming manganganak na si mommy. Sabi kase nung OB nya, next, next week pa daw."

"Doktor kase yun, hindi manghuhula," Lei said.

"Oo na Analeigh."

 

--

 

Palaging nasa bahay nila ang barkada, kinukunan sila ng video at picture. Ang daddy naman nya ay ayaw nang lubayan ang mommy nya. Todo alaga ito. He wanted to take care of the baby but she insisted that she will do it.

Ayaw na nga niyang bitawan ang kapatid kahit ngalay na ngalay na sya.

 

One time ay nakipag-video chat ang barkada kay Zelo.

"Bagay ba sa 'kin ang may baby?" nakangiti nyang tanong dito.

Bahagyang namula ang pisngi nito at nag-iwas ito ng tingin.

"Grabe, anak agad? Di pa nga kasal!" Eula said in exaggeration.

"Oo nga. Pasintabi naman. May nasasaktan," sabat ni Eli sabay tingin kay Keeme.

 

Nakisakay naman si Keeme sa biro ng barkada. Inakbayan sya nito. "Mas bagay kaya kami," nakangiti niyang sabi.

Zelo glared at them. "Humanda ka sa 'kin Eli."

"Hala! Bakit ako?" lito nitong tanong.

"Di ba may usapan tayo?" 

Napakamot ito sa ulo. "Ano na nga?"

"Haaaay... maaasahan ka talaga kahit kelan," Zelo said sarcastically.

 

They all laughed. "Sige na. Lalayo na po. Baka umiyak ka pa," Keeme teased.

 

"Sweetie?" 

 

She saw her daddy peep through the ajar door.

"Yes dad?"

"Baka naman gusto mong ipahiram sa 'kin ang kapatid mo?" tanong nito.

"Ay... sorry dad. Here... balik mo din mamaya ha."

 

"Kawawa naman yung tatay, hindi na mahawakan ang anak."

 

Natawa si daddy sa tinuran ni Eula. "True. Excited na yatang magka-baby ang panganay ko eh," tudyo ng ama sa kanya.

"Nandito po yung magiging tatay," sabi ni Lei sabay turo kay Zelo.

Daddy squinted. "Hey kid... 'wag muna ha."

"Hindi pa po muna talaga. Wala akong pambili ng gatas kung sakali," sagot nito.

"Mayaman naman kami kaya okay lang," sabat niya.

 

"Hey..." saway ng daddy nya.

"I'm kidding dad. Takot ko lang sa 'yo."

"Good. I'll go now. See you guys around," paalam nito sa kanila.

 

--

 

"Eto na si baby..." ngiting-ngiting sabi ni Dani sa asawa.

"Thank God!" Kinuha niya ang anak mula sa asawa. She kissed her baby girl's little forehead. Hinalikan naman siya ng asawa sa labi.

"Can I get you anything?" tanong nito sa kanya.

"I'm craving for some fruits. Can you get me a fruit platter dad?"

"Sure thing. I'll be back." He kissed her again. "I love you."

"Love you too daddy."

Hinalikan naman nito ang anak. "Love you baby."

 

The little girl cackled in response.

 

--

 

Nasa terrace sina Keeme at Lei, kumakain ng pizza at French fries na galing sa Greenwich. Nasa loob ng kwarto ang mga kaibigan nila, naglalaro ng Wii kasama si Dyma.

"Okay ka lang pre?" tanong ni Lei sa kaibigan.

"Basag na basag na nga eh," sagot nito habang tinatapik ang dibdib. Hindi niya malaman kung matatawa ba sya dahil puno ng pagkain yung isa nitong pisngi habang nagsasalita o maaawa dahil nakangiti ito kahit animo'y gustong umiyak.

"Ayos lang yan." Tinapik-tapik niya ang balikat nito.

"Ikaw kumusta?"

 

Napabuntong-hininga siya.

"Eto... umaasa pa rin. Parang tanga noh? Nakakainis kase."

"Nilagyan pa ng parang, tanga ka naman talaga," he replied.

Binigyan nya ito ng masamang tingin. "Eh kesa naman ikaw!"

Tumawa ito. "Ayos lang naman sa 'kin eh. Tanggap ko na namang wala akong pag-asa. Eh ikaw?"

"Tss. Oo na."

 

They both felt silent. Both were munching each slice of pepperoni pizza.

 

"Hoy Astel, may idea ako."

"Ano yun, Tolentino?"

 

Tiningnan niya ito ng mabuti. Nakakunot ang noo nito at nag-aantay ng sunod nyang sasabihin. Huminga sya ng malalim.

 

 

"Kung tayo na lang kaya?"

 

xxxx

AN: Idudugsong ko na lang yung other parts ng interview sa barkada after some time. Basta, sasabihan ko na lang kayo. Dagdag chapter pa kase kapag hinati-hati ko pa. Ayan... UD ko. Hahaha... Kthanksbye~~~

Just say YES.

"Best, mapupunit na mukha mo kakangiti. Ano'ng meron?" tanong niya sa kaibigan. Kanina pa nakangiti si Eula habang nagtetext sa cellphone nito.

Napatingin ang iba nyang barkada kay Eula sa tinuran niya.

"Katext nya na naman yata si Jairus," hula ni Eli.

"Parang may iba eh," puna ni Chastene. "She does not smile that way when it's Jairus."

Kumunot ang noo ni Lei sa kapatid nito. "May hindi ka ba sinasabi sa 'kin Yolanda?"

"Maka-Yolanda ka naman ate!" saway nito sa kapatid.

"Wag mong ibahin ang usapan," sabat ni Dama.

 

Tiningnan sila nito ng isa-isa. "Bakit ba ako ang nasa hot seat ngayong araw? Di ba pwedeng si Keeme naman?"

"Sawa na kami sa pangha-hard kay Keeme, ikaw naman."

"So... bakit nga mukhang ang saya-saya mo Eula?" tanong ni Chastene sa kaibigan.

 

Eula blushed. "Wag nga kayo! Iba na lang kase ang topic!" Lalong naintriga ang barkada. Inagaw ni Lei ang cellphone sa kapatid. "Ate!"

Hinawakan nina Keeme at Lei ang tigkabilang braso ni Eula. Nakiusyoso naman kay Lei sina Dama at Chastene.

Sabay-sabay na napangiti ang tatlong dalaga.

 

"Jairus daw."

"James pala..."

"Kelan pa Eula?"

"Ayeeee... sabi ko naman sa 'yo mas bagay kayo ni James eh!"

 

"Wala lang yan!" tanggi ni Eula.

 

"Wala lang? Eh bakit namumula ka?" taas-kilay na tanong ni Dama.

"Kutis artista kase ako kaya mamula-mula!" sagot naman nito sa kanya.

"Kuuu... tatanggi pa eh! Ano ba kaseng meron sa inyo?"

 

Nabitawan ng dalawang lalaki ang braso ni Eula nang bigla itong naupo sa upuan na nasa likuran nito. Nakatingin lang sila dito, naghihintay ng sagot.

Lalo itong namula kaya nagtakip ito ng mukha para hindi nila makita ang pagkapahiya nito.

"Nanlululugu nuhh sthuukuun shuuu Juuums."

"Ano?" Dama asked.

 

Tinanggal ni Eula ang kamay na nakatakip sa bibig. "Wala nang ulitan sa bingi!"

"So ganyanan?" tanong niya rito. She reached for Eula's phone saka idinial ang number ni James. "Itatanong ko na lang sa kanya," banta niya sa kaibigan.

"Walang pantawag yan."

"Ay poor!" sabi niya. She fished her iPhone from her pocket. "Buti na lang marami akong load."

Nanlaki ang mata ni Eula at pilit na inagaw sa kanya ang iPhone niya pero hinarang ito nina Eli.

"Wag! Bespren naman eh!" paghuhuramentadu nito.

 

She punched in James's number. Saka nya itinapat sa tenga ang cellphone.

"Wait! Teka! Sasabihin ko na!" Eula said in defeat.

"Too late best. Nagriring na eh. Eto wait-Hello?" Ini-loud speaker nya ang phone. "James!"

"Sino 'to?"

"James!" her friend's chorused.

 

"End mo na yung call dali!" Eula shrieked.

"Eula?"

"Kinidnap namin si Eula. You have to go here para ma-rescue mo sya," nakangiting sabi ng dalaga.

"My gosh... why so conyo?" Lei rolled her eyes.

"Joke ba 'to?" tanong ni James.

"Oo joke lang yan! Wag kang maniniwala sa mga yan!" pasigaw naman na sagot ni Eula.



"Hindi joke 'to. Hindi mo na makikita si Eula kapag hindi ka umamin sa 'min."

"Aamin? Ano namang aaminin ko?"

 

"Kayo na ba ni Yolanda?" tanong ni Lei.

"Ate!" Pinandilatan si Lei ng kapatid.

Narining nilang tumawa ang nasa kabilang linya.

"Hindi..."

 

"Weh?" takang-tanong ng magbabarkada.

 

"Eh ayaw akong sagutin eh..." dagdag ni James.

"Ayeeee! So nanliligaw ka?" kilig na kilig na tanong ni Eli.

"Oo. Bat di nyo alam? Akala ko ba magbabarkada kayo?"

"Eh hindi naman kase sinasabi ni Yolanda sa 'min eh. She's very shy, you know," sabat ni Chastene. Nagtakip ng mukha si Eula sa sobrang kahihiyan.

"I hate you!" sabi ng dalaga sa kanila.

"Uy Eula sorry ha..."

 

"Heh! Di na kita kakausapin."

"Hala naman... eh pano yung lakad natin bukas?" nag-aalala nitong tanong.

"Ayeeee... may date sila bukas!" tudyo naman ng barkada.

"Wala na! Cancelled na!"

"Wala namang ganyanan..."

Inirapan ni Eula ang phone as if it's James himself. "Mabuti pa si Jairus-"

"Jairus na naman?!"

 

Nanahimik ang barkada ng marinig ang bahagyang iritasyon sa boses ni James. Napatingin sila kay Eula na napakagat-labi naman atg parang sising-sisi sa binitawang mga salita...

"Sige cancelled na lang. Galit ka nga yata. Sorry," pagkasabi nito ay biglang nag-disconnect yung call.

 

"Nakakainis!" padabog na sabi ng dalaga. "Kayo kase!" sisi nito sa kanila.

"Aba sino ba'ng tumatanggi?"

"Saka ano namang masama kung natauhan ka na?" tanong ni Lei sa kapatid.

"Nagtampo na tuloy..."

 

Nakonsensya naman si Dama sa ginawa nila sa kaibigan. She dialed James's number again. Nang sagutin nito ay iniabot niya ang phone kay Eula.

Kinuha ito ng dalaga at saka ito lumayo sa barkada.

 

--

 

"So pano nga nangyari na nililigawan ka ng poste na yun? Di ba alam nyang si Jairus ang gusto mo?" tanong niya sa kaibigan.

"Eeee...." medyo kinikilig na usal ni Eula.

"Ano nga? Spill it."

Palibhasa ay bakasyon at walang summer class ang magbabarkada ay nakatambay na naman sila sa mansion nina Dama. Wala ng inuwian. Uuwi lang sila kapag namimiss na nila ang kanya-kanyang pamilya tapos after two days ay babalik ulit sila kina Dama.

 

"Eh kase... nung last day. Papirmahan ng clearance... nilapitan nya 'ko. Tapos sabi nya, libre daw nya ako ng ramen dun sa food stall sa tabi ng kubo. Eh di sumama naman ako-"

"Kase libre," dugtong ni Lei.

Eula giddily nodded her head. "Eh tapos, tinanong nya 'ko kung saan ako magbabakasyon. Sabi ko dito lang."

"Tapos?"

"Tapos tinanong nya 'ko kung kapag daw ba may nanligaw sa 'kin na hindi Jairus ang pangalan eh kung may pag-asa daw..."

"Ano'ng sabi mo?" tanong ni Keeme.

"Sabi ko, depende kung sino'ng manliligaw na hindi Jairus ang pangalan. Tapos ano..." She giggled.

"Landi nito. Tapusin mo muna ang kwento bago ka mangisay," asiwang sabi ni Lei.

"Tapos... tapos..." tumawa ito. "Shet. Kinikilig ako!"

 

Kinutusan ni Lei ang kapatid.

 

"Aray ko naman ate!"

"Tapusin mo na kase yung kwento mo," Lei replied blandly.

"Oo nga. Tapos ano?" curious na tanong ni Eli.

 

"Tapos pano daw kung James yung pangalan ng manliligaw sa 'kin. Mwahaha!" Tuluyan ng kinilig ang dalaga. Hinampas-hampas pa nito ang mga barkada sa sobrang katuwaan.

Panay ang reklamo ng mga nahampas. Tawa naman ng tawa si Dyma na noo'y nakikinig lang sa isang sulok. Nakasanayan na kase nitong nandoon sa bahay ang barkada ng ate nito.

 

"Ano sagot mo?" tanong naman ni Dama sa kaibigan.

"Wala. Speechless," nakangiti nitong sagot. "Hindi na nga yata ako nakakain after eh..."

Si Chastene naman ang nagtanong. "So, pano na si Jairus?"

Nagkibit-balikat si Eula. "Bahala sya."

 

"Wow...  samantalang dati halos maglupasay ka dyan mapansin lang ni Jairus."

"Wala na akong pakialam sa bansot na yun. Bahala sya."

 

Natawa ang barkada. "Bansot? Akala ko ba cute yun?"

"Cute nga! Bansot lang. Buti pa si James matangkad."

"Grabe Eula... para kang tinanggalan ng tabing sa mata. Ngayon mo lang narealize yan?"

"Sorry naman. May cuteness goggles kase si Jai eh," paliwanag nito.

"Eh pano yan? Mas madalas na kayong magkatext ni James?" tanong ni Keeme.

"Hindi noh. Mas madalas pa rin kami ni Jairus," sagot nito.

Kumunot ang noo ni Eli. "Ngek. Bakit ganun? Di ba dapat mas madalas kayong magka-text ni James?"

 

Bigla na namang kinilig itong si Eula. "Eh kase madalas kaming magkatawagan!" sagot nito sabay tawa. Nailing na lamang sila sa kahibangan nito. Minsan lang kase ito magkaganun sa ibang lalaki. Dati puro Jairus na lang.... pagbigyan na.

 

--

 

"Dad?" Meg hushed as she entered their room. Nakita niya ang asawa na nakaupo sa kama. Nakasandal ito sa headboard habang hinehele ang anak na kalong nito.

Nakita niyang natutulog na ang anak nila. Dani gently laid the baby on his side saka sya nito tiningnan at nginitian.

"Yes?" tanong nito.

Naupo siya sa gilid ng kama. "Wala naman." Yumakap siya sa asawa. "I love you daddy."

She heard him chuckle. "Is it 'I Love You' day today?"

"No," she said. Hinarap niya ang asawa. "Masamang magsabi ng 'I Love You' out of the blue?" tanong niya.

"Hindi naman. Hindi lang ako sanay."

 

Naiintindihan nya ang asawa. Madalas kase ay ito ang nag-iinitiate. Madalas rin na hindi niya nari-reciprocate iyon.

She pinched her husband's cheeks. "Ang gwapo mo daddy."

Bahagya itong namula. "Ano ba'ng nakain mo at nagkakaganyan ka?" tanong nito ng nakaiwas ang tingin sa kanya.

She pouted. "Ayaw mo ba dad?"

"Gusto," sagot agad nito. "I'm just not used to it."

She smiled at him saka nya iyo niyakap muli. "I love you dad."

Tumawa ito ng mahina at hinalikan sya sa noo. "I love you more."

"Ang gwapo-gwapo mo talaga today," pangungulit niya sa asawa.

Muli itong tumawa saka siya hinalikan sa pisngi. "At ang kulit-kulit mo naman mommy."

Ikinawit niya ang mga braso niya sa leeg nito. "Aalis ka na naman kase. I'll miss you."

"You know I'd bring you if I could pero kawawa naman ang baby natin kapag isinama kita," sabi nito. He kissed her forehead and continued, "So I guess I'll have to do without you for a week."

"Hindi mo naman siguro ikakamatay yun noh?" she teased.

"Hmmm... hindi naman siguro. But I'll miss you for sure... kaya pagsasawain ko na ang sarili ko sa 'yo ngayon before leaving tomorrow," he said with a laugh and began nibbling her neck.

"Daddy baka magising si baby!" she hissed.

"Di yan," sabi naman nito at nagpatuloy sa ginagawa. Hinampas-hampas nya ito sa dibdib para tumigil but he only stopped when the baby stirred.

Natigilan silang dalawa at nag-anticipate sa pag-iyak ng bata... but the baby was still fast asleep.

"Sabi ko sa 'yo eh... tulog mantika kaya yan," sabi nito sa kanya.

"Hmp. Ang kulit mo. Sa kabila na nga lang tayo, magising pa yan," she suggested.

Tinawagan nila ang isang katulong mula sa intercom ng kwarto. Pero nang bumukas ang pinto ay ang dalawa nilang anak ang pumasok sa kwarto.

"Sige na, maglandian na kayo. Kami na muna ang magbabantay," their eldest said.

"Thanks sweetie," nakangiting sabi ni Dani dito. They both kissed their children on each cheeks and then they headed out of the room for their alone time.

Later that night, Dama received an international call from North Carolina...

"Hello?" she greeted as she wondered why he suddenly called.

"Hi," he replied.

She smiled widely. "Bakit ka napatawag? Namiss mo 'ko?"

"Uuwi na 'ko bukas," he answered curtly.

"Eeeee? Sure ka?!" Excitement was evident on her voice. Paano kase, instead of September ay uuwi ito ng katapusan ng May. Abot pa ito sa birthday niya. And then he'd propose to her on her birthday. Birthday turned to engagement ang mangyayari and everyone will know that they're official.

Saka na lamang siguro niya poproblemahin ang apelyido nito.

She heard him sigh on the other line. "Oo nga. Sige."

"Uy teka! What time?"

"Basta maghintay ka bukas," sagot nito before hanging up. Not letting his sour mood get into the way of her excitement, tinawagan ng dalaga ang mga kaibigan para sabihin ang magandang balita. Well, good news for her.

 

--

 

Kinabukasan, she called the airport to know the time of Zelo's arrival. Nang malaman niyang gabi pa ay isinama niya ang magkapatid na kabarkada para mag-shopping ng bagong damit. Malay ba naman nya kung sa airport pala ito magpo-propose.

Dapat ay maganda siya.

 

She spent the whole day pampering herself. Nagpa-spa sya, mani and pedi at nagpa-treatment ng buhok. Kulang na nga lang ay magsuot sya ng gown para deretso kasal na.

Naiiling na lamang ang mga kaibigan sa sobrang ka-OA-yan niya.

 

They arrived at the airport by 9pm dahil mga bandang alas dyes pa raw ang dating ng binata. They all waited patiently for him and then a little while later, his plane arrived.

She ran excitedly to him upon seeing him walking towards them. Isang back pack lamang at isang carry on ang dala nito.

She smiled at him... but he didn't smile back.

 

Napatigil siya pagtakbo nang mapansin na parang may kakaiba rito. His aura and expression were different. Like something's off...

Hindi na sya nakakibo hanggang sa tumigil ito sa tapat nya... his eyes never leaving hers.

"W-Welco-" She didn't finish what she was about to say because he suddenly grabbed her and trapped her inside his arms.

 

"Kadiri kayo!"

"Sa airport na naman nag-PDA!"

"Walangya!"

 

She felt Zelo pulled her closer. Then after a while, his shoulders began to shake. Natigil ang panunudyo sa kanila ng barkada ng mapansin nilang lahat na umiiyak na ito.

"Z-Zelo? What's wrong?"

He didn't say anything. Tahimik lang itong umiyak...

 

--

 

They all sat quietly on her bed. Nakapaikot sila sa binata habang ito naman ay nakatungo lamang, malungkot na malungkot.

"Okay ka lang pre?" tanong ni Keeme dito habang tinatapik-tapik ang balikat nito.

Umiling ito bilang sagot saka ito tumingin sa kanya. "Patay na ang nanay ko," he said coldly.

 

Nagulat silang lahat sa sinabi nito. Lalo na ang mga barkada nito na hindi naman alam na hinanap nito ang nanay nito. They told them the whole story and bit by bit, they understood. Dalawang buwan na palang patay ang nanay nito.

With no private investigator to help him find his mother, he resulted into relying to hearsay and directions from people who were supposed to know where she is.

Nang mahanap nito ang huling address ng ina ay nalaman nito na dalawang buwan ng patay ang nanay nito.

 

"Nandito naman kami eh..." sabi ni Eli na tinabihan ito para akbayan.

"Oo nga pre. Ayos lang yan. Hindi ka naman nauubusan ng pamilya," dagdag ni Keeme.

"Saka ikakasal rin naman kayo ni best friend. Magkakatatay at nanay ka na ulit."

 

Pinilit nitong ngumiti. "Ayaw naman nyan sa apelyido ko eh," sagot nito habang nakatingin sa kanya.

Nilapitan nya ito at hinawakan ang tigkabilang pisngi. "Your first name was given by your mother. Your last was from your father. Pangalan mo na lang ang alaalang naiwan nila sa 'yo... matatanggihan ko pa ba yun? Okay lang kahit Zonrox ang last name mo noh..."

She was glad that made him laugh.

"Sira," nakangiti nitong sabi sabay gulo sa buhok nya.

"Ano ka... sabi mo magpo-propose ka pagbalik mo!" paalala niya rito.

"Oo na." Dumukot ito sa bulsa nito. "Pag-iipunan ko pa yung engagement ring. Siguro mga five years pa. Sa ngayon ito muna." Isinuot nito sa palasingsingan niya ang isang aluminum wire na ginawang singsing.

"Ang tagal naman nung five years!" reklamo niya.

"Sige, gawin nating 10."

"Luh!"

Tumawa ito. "Pag-ipunin mo nga muna ako."

"Hmp. Sige na. Sige na..."

"Kulit mo." Hinila siya nito at niyakap. May narinig siyang umaray mula sa paligid. Malamang ay si Keeme na naman iyon, nagdadrama.

 

"Group hug!" someone exclaimed. Maya-maya pa'y nasu-suffocate na sya sa patong-patong na yakap ng mga kaibigan.

 

--

 

Tulog na ang magbabarkada na nakahiga sa sahig ng kwarto ni Dama nang biglang bumangon si Astel para magpahangin sa labas. Medyo nagulat siya ng maabutan ang kaibigang si Lei na nakaupo sa mismong railings. Malapad naman ito at nauupuan, kaya lang ay nakakalula dahil mataas ang pwesto.

"Hoy," bati niya rito.

"Hoy ka rin," sagot nito.

"Bat di ka pa natutulog?" tanong niya rito. He tried getting to the spot next to her kaso ay medyo nanginginig ang braso niya sa takot. Takot kase sya sa matataas na lugar.

"Mag-uumaga na kase," sagot nito.

Inaninag niya ang suot na relo. "Tae ka. Alas tres pa lang kaya."

"Oh? Ano ba yun? Di ba umaga?" taas-kilay nitong tanong.

Nailing na lamang siya sa sagot nito. Hindi kase siya maka-retaliate. Sa lahat ng kaibigan niya bukod kay Dama at Zelo, si Lei ang pinaka-magaling sa come back.

Humahabol na nga rin si Chastene.

 

"Lei."

"Ano?"

Huminga muna siya ng malalim bago sya nagsalita. "Wala. Nawala sa isip ko."

Binatukan sya nito. "Gagi."

He laughed. "Matutulog na 'ko. Wag kang tatalon ha? Wala akong pang-abuloy."

Tiningnan sya nito ng masama. "Eh kung ikaw kaya ang naihuhulog ko?"

"Sus... di magawa."

"Halika dito!" paghahamon nito.

"Ayoko nga!"

"Takot ka pala eh!"

 

"Hoy 'wag maingay aba!" sigaw ni Eula mula sa loob. Natahimik ang dalawa. Nagkatinginan... saka mahinang tumawa.

 

"Hoy Lei," tawag niya rito.

"Ano na naman?"

 

"Liligawan kita ha?"

 

Nanlaki ang mga mata nito. "A-Ano?!"

"Wala ng ulitan," sagot niya sabay pasok ng kwarto. Hindi rin niya alam kung bakit bigla na lang lumabas sa bibig niya yun.

Siguro dahil masaya sya kapag kasama si Lei? O dahil kahit palagi silang magkaaway ay dikit pa rin sila. Hindi niya alam... pero para kaseng... tama.

Kinabukasan...

Halo-halo ang atmosphere... Medyo malungkot si Meg dahil wala si Dani. Medyo nagkakailangan sina Astel at Lei dahil sa nangyari kaninang madaling araw. Medyo close na sina Chastene at Eli dahil ang hilig nilang magkulitan. Medyo sweet sina Dama at Zelo dahil hindi na ulit aalis si Zelo ng bansa.

Medyo kinikilig si Eula dahil inaya ulit syang mag-date ni James.

At medyo kulang dahil wala si Dyma sa hapag-kainan.

"Sweetie, can you call your brother?" Meg asked her daughter.

"Sure mom," sagot naman ng dalaga. Agad itong tumayo at pinnuntahan ang kapatid na nakakulong na naman sa kwarto nito.

 

"Hey noob-" Natigilan ang dalaga sa nakita. She immediately locked the door at saka sumigaw. Sound-proofed naman ang kwarto nito kaya okay lang. "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!"              

*******************************************
[52] Epilogue
*******************************************
 

"You have to tell dad," pamimilit niya sa kapatid.

"I'm scared ate," he replied.

Kakarating pa lamang ng daddy nila galing sa byahe nito overseas. Hawak-hawak niya ang kamay ng kapatid at sabay silang nagpunta sa kwarto ng mga magulang.

"Dad'll hate me," malungkot nitong sabi sa kanya.

"He might," she answered. "I'm not gonna lie and say that he will just accept it. But don't worry... I'm here for you, 'kay?"

Tumango ito at hinigpitan ang kapit sa kamay niya.

 

They entered the room without even knocking. Nakita nila ang mga magulang na magkayakap sa tapat ng isa nilang cabinet. Namimili kase ng damit ang mommy nila habang nakayakap naman dito ang daddy nila at hinahalik-halikan ito.

Tumikhim ang dalaga.

"Mommy, daddy... Dyma has something to tell you," she announced.

 

Humarap sa kanila ang mga magulang. Nakangiti ang mommy nila sa kanila while their dad was hugging her from behind.

"Yes baby?" her mom asked Dyma.

 

Nakita niyang tumungo ang kapatid at nangingilid na ang luha.

 

"M-Mom... d-dad..."

 

"Nakabuntis po si Dyma," singit niya. Nawalan ng kulay ang mukha ng mommy nya.

"No way!"

 

Gusto niyang matawa sa reaction nito but she stopped herself.

 

"M-Ma... that's not it!" tutol ng kapatid niya.

"What is it then? Let's not play pranks on your mother Dama," their dad reprimanded.

"I'm pretty sure you'll like what I said better," sagot niya sa ama.

 

"So joke lang yun?!" iritadong tanong ng mommy nila.

"Yes ma... the truth is..."

 

Huminga si Dyma ng malalim. She gripped her brother's hand and nodded at him.

"Whatever happens noob, I'm here for you."

 

Dyma smiled bitterly at her at saka ito humugot ng malalim na hininga. Then he looked at his parents and prayed that whatever happens... they would still love him...

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

"I'm gay."

*******************************************
[53] Author's Note
*******************************************
Nakatapos ulit ako! Yey! Haha... so... err. Dyma's yeah--he's gay. Wala eh. Di ko napigilan ang sarili ko. Hahaha... 

Anyway, sa mga top picks ko for Dyma's Maiden, you can back out now. I'm giving you this chance to be angry at him or be disgusted (though I don't know why you would... might... probably...). Hindi ko naman kayo masisisi kung yung ideal guy eh naging ganun pala.

But please don't hate him. Kahit character ko yun eh mahal ko yun. :)

 

Enough about Dyma...

 

Eto na yata yung story na sobrang nakapagpasakit ng ulo ko. Ang daming umaway sa 'kin dahil sa character na si Dama. Haha... Pero masaya. Basta. Worth it ang puyat at distraction na naibigay ng story na 'to.

Eto na rin yata ang pinakagusto kong story na naisulat ko in third person's POV. Hindi dahil sa sya ang pinakang sumikat kundi dahil napanindigan ko hanggang huli.

I tried making stories before in third person's POV kaso hindi ko natagalan dahil na-bore ako. Dito hindi. Ewan.... masaya pramis.

Yung interview wth the barkada... di ko sure kung magagawa ko pa. Pero susubukan ko talaga. Sorry po. Ang dami lang kase, na-overwhelm ako.

 

Anyway, I won't finish this note without even saying thank you. THANK YOU po sa lahat ng walang sawang naghintay sa UD. Sa mga magugulong mag-comment. Sa mga affected much sa story. Nakakatuwa kase walang masyadong negative. 

So far nga, wala masyado. Natatakot tuloy akong gumawa ng isa pa. XD

 

Ayun, thank you po sa inyo. :)

 

Sa top picks ko, quit or go? Your choice. Inform me please. I wanna know. Para matanggal ko sa choices yung magba-back out at para less headache sa pagpili. Ang gagaling nyo kase. XD

 

SALAMAT!

Meg: Her attitude.

"Baka naman naiinis ka kay Dama dahil di mo matanggap na mas maganda siya sayo?"

Meg: Lol. Mas maganda ako. (Oooohhh... mas maganda kaya ako. Hahaha. Joke lang. XD)

"Meron ka bang nakahandang Plan B kung hindi pa rin magbabago si Dama?"

Meg: Yes. Put her in a sack and put her in a drum and put cement inside. Throw her in the seas. (Grabe noh? Sadista. Tsk tsk.)

"Aware ka bang iniisip ni Dyma na second best lang siya?"

Meg: No.

"Anong nararamdaman mo ngayon sa pagbabago ni Dama?"

Meg: Happy, of course.

"Anong maipapayo mo sa kanya ngayong she's torn between two lovers?"

Meg: Pick the one who loves you. (Zelo! *u*)

 

From Shaile:

"Papayag ka bang magkarelasyon si Dama sa isang dukha?"

Meg: Itanong mo kay Dani yan. That's my question. (I think he's also fine with it.)

"Maari bang hiramin ng isang gabi si Dani. Hihihi."

Meg: NO. Baka makakuha pa siya ng sakit sa'yo. (LOL dito. Hahaha)

"Anong ipapangalan mo sa next baby nyo?" (Wala pa syang naiisip.)

"Gusto mo na bang ibalik si Dama sa mansion?"

It's twelve o'clock and we were here hiding in the bushes... me and Kim. I kinda promised her something and Meg might kill me for it pero dahil di ko sya matanggihan.... eto kami.

I called on Dani's phone earlier asking him to come out by midnight.

Tulog na si Meg--sana.

 

Nakita namin syang lumabas from the house and then he sat at the chair near the pool area. He dialled someone's number on his phone.

"Shi--" My phone started ringing. Aish. Agad ko iyong sinagot. "Hello..." I said in a hushed voice.

"Where are you? And may I know what this is all about?"

"Basta. Nandito lang kami sa tabi-tabi. May babaeng lalapit sa 'yo and she'll say something. You better listen ha?" sagot ko sa kanya.

"Okay. But please make it quick. Meg might wake up. She'll get angry kapag wala ako sa tabi nya."

"Okay." I ended the call and faced Kim. "Kim... mabilisan lang ha. Sa cheeks lang!" paalala ko sa kanya.

"Yes naman Author!" Megash. She's so giddy.

"Go."

 

Kim jumped out of the bushes and ran towards Dani. Gulat man, he stayed still to hear what she has to say... na wala naman talaga kase gusto lang nyang makanakaw ng kiss.

My jaw dropped when she kissed him. Ang usapang sa cheeks... nauwi sa lips. Nabigla din si Dani kaya hindi sya nakareact agad.

"Dad!"




"Ooops! Gotta go!" Kim waved at Meg saka ito nagtatakbo papunta sa 'kin. Nakitakbo na rin ako palayo.

 

"Adik ka! Sabi ko sa cheeks lang!" I blurted out ng makalabas kami sa premise na yun.

Tumawa sya. "Eh nandun na eh! Alangan namang di ko samantalahin?"

Napailing na lang ako. "Oh? Kumusta naman?"

"Ang sarap! Kung di nga lang dumating si Meg... ito-torrid ko sana eh."

LOL. Ang adik lang nya. "Baliw."

She smiled at me. "Sige na. Thank you!"

"No probs."

(Wala.)

 

Krizhateru - Bat po Pierre ang ginamit niyong pangalan noong inutusan kayo ni author na magpanggap para bantayan si  Dama? Bakit hindi mo na lang po ginamit yung true name mo? May feelings ka po ba para kay Dama. Kahit kati-ting lang? J

(Because those are my instructions. Alangan namang suwayin ko yung utos ng nagbayad sa 'kin?)

"Nasan tayo?" tanong ni Eula kay Eli.

"Aba malay!" sagot ni Eli na patingin-tingin sa paligid.

 

Earlier that day, the four of them were escorted to a secluded place. Ang sabi sa kanila ay makikipag-meet sa kanila si Dama. Sumama naman sila agad dahil akala nila ay pakulo na naman ito ng kaibigan nila.

But we know better, right?

 

"Baka kinidnap tayo? Hala!"

"Sira ka ba? Bat tayo kikidnapin eh wala tayong pera?"

"Sina Eli po may tindahan! Sya na lang hingan nyo ng ransom!"

"Pero seryoso... asan ba tayo?"

 

"Guys, gusto nyo ng cake?" tanong ni Eli sa mga kaibigan. He took a slice for himself at saka sya prenteng kumain habang nakaupo sa malambot na sofa.

 

"Eli may lason yan."

Biglang iniluwa ni Eli yung kinakain nya. Nailing na lang ako sa usapan ng mga batang are. I stepped out of the secret room na nasa likuran lang ng bookshelf.

 

"Walang lason yan Eli."

 

Lahat sila ay napatingin sa akin.

"Sino ka?"

"Wala po kaming pera ate!"

"Walang lason? Ayos!"

 

Naupo ako sa upuan na katapat nilang apat. "I'm here to do an interview."

"Interview? Ay, hindi po kami nag-aapply ng trabaho," sagot ni Eula.

"Opo. Next year pa OJT namin," dagdag naman ni Keeme.

 

Napangiti na lang ako sa kanila. "Don't worry guys... simpleng interview lang 'to. Eli, please stop eating. Okay. I'll start na ha?"

 

(Legends: Y for EULA, L for LEI, E for ELI, K for KEEME and A for AUTHOR)

A: Huy! Bawal ang sakitan!

L: Normal na po sa 'min 'to.

K: Masakit na ang batok ko ha! *singhal sa dalawa*

A: Tama na... Eula, may pag-asa daw ba si Keeme sayo?

Y: *rolls eyes* Wala nga.

A: Okay. Lei, kung magiging si Keeme at Eula, papayag ka?

L: Hindi. Ayoko. *points at Keeme* *squints*

A: Keeme, bakit daw si Eula?

K: Ganun talaga. Hashtag pogi.

E: Yak. Pre, di bagay.

 

A: Next na! Next na! From skyeris, Lei bat ka daw nagagalit kapag tinatawag kang nerd?

Y: Duh-gawa ni ex. Nagbabasa pa kayo?

L: *tiningnan ng masama si Eula*

Y: Sorry ate.

A: Keeme, bakit di ka na lang magtapat kay Eula?

K: Kase si Eli ang gusto ko.

L: Sasapakin na kita!

K: *tawa*

 

"Oy... kumain muna kayo ng cake," sabi ko sa kanila.

Agad namang kinuha ni Eli yung plato ng cake na kinakain nya kanina.

"Wala po bang juice?" tanong ni Eula.

"Meron. Saglit at kukuha ako."

 

I stood up and went to the kitchen na konting lakad lang mula sa sala. Naloloka ako sa sagot ng mga batang yun...

So ayun, merienda muna kami. Interview again later. :)
